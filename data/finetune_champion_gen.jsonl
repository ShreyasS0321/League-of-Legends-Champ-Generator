But after centuries of imprisonment, Aatrox was the first to find freedom once more, corrupting and transforming those foolish enough to try and wield the magical weapon that contained his essence. Now with stolen flesh, he walks Runeterra in a brutal approximation of his previous form, seeking an apocalyptic and long overdue vengeance.\nAs a mortal, Aatrox was born and raised in Shurima at the height of its power. He eventually became a champion of the empire, being honored for his service as a strong warrior. During this time, he had served it for all his life. He was a noble warrior and would not hesitate to fight alongside his fellow soldiers in battle.\nAatrox was one of the first to be granted the gift of Ascension in the ancient times of Shurima, a rite that was reserved for those near the end of their life. [ 1 ] Once he was Ascended, Aatrox was granted a heightened role within the military as a member of the Ascended Host. As one of the most powerful of the Ascended, Aatrox fought and even killed Spirit Gods and other powerful beings. [ 2 ]\nWhen Icathia rebelled against the emperor , the Ascended hero Setaka requested that Aatrox aid her in fighting them back alongside the rest of the Ascended Host. Answering the call with no hesitation, he helped drive back the Void when the Icathians tried weaponizing it, an event that deeply scarred his mind and lead to the loss of his wings.\nAatrox standing among his fellow Darkin, Varus and Rhaast\nAfter the Shuriman Empire fell due to the sudden death of emperor Azir , the Ascended renamed themselves Sunborn and clashed with each other due to the lack of leadership and purpose. Their battle brought so much devastation that the mortals eventually began to call these Sunborn Darkin , an old Shuriman word which most closely translated to 'The Fallen.'\nDuring the war, Aatrox was an honored general who commanded several other Darkin to his side in an attempt to unify them again. It's implied that Aatrox was one of five notably powerful Darkin that fought side by side during the war and sought to bring ruin to the entire world once reunited. These Darkin include Aatrox himself, Rhaast , Varus , Naafiri and an unknown fifth Darkin. [ 3 ]\nRyze witnessing a vision of the Darkin War, seeing the moment where Aatrox and Xolaani began their violent conflict.\nAatrox had a particular rivalry with Xolaani , who utilized her talents in blood magic to puppeteer the bodies of the other Darkin to her will in an attempt to end the war. [ 4 ] Horiffied by this, Aatrox named Xolaani a coward for her methods and honed a deep, violent hatred for her. [ 5 ]\nFearing for the fate of Runeterra, the Celestial beings of Targon intervened as the 5 Aspect of War , also known as Pantheon , rallied mortals to fight back against the Darkin while Myisha the Aspect of Twilight taught mortals how to imprison the Darkin within their own weapons. Aatrox fought against Pantheon with an army of his own, ultimately losing and becoming deceived as he became one of the first Darkin to become imprisoned. Trapped within his sword in a torturous existence, Aatrox continued to hopelessly reach out of his prison in agony.\nEventually, an unknown mortal man fled a battle and, out of desperation to defend himself, tried to wield Aatrox's sword. Using hemomancy, Aatrox quickly took over this human's body and reformed it as close to his original Ascended form as possible. Fearing that this body was too weak to withstand his Darkin essence, Aatrox looked toward a city caught in the middle of a chaotic battle and planned to slaughter as many mortals as possible and repurpose their corpses to strengthen his new form. [ 6 ]\nAatrox possessed many men and women over the years, learning how to take over a body instantly and feast on his enemies' flesh. Aatrox travelled the world in search of a way to return to his Ascended form but realized that there was no escape from his prison and despaired. With that, Aatrox grew desperate and decided that since he cannot truly free himself from the blade, he would instead end all of existence including himself in a terrible cataclysm. Marching with a new purpose, Aatrox brought war and death wherever he went, hoping to create a battle apocalyptic enough to bring oblivion to everything.\nAt some point, Aatrox gathered and lead a massive army of raiders and lead them to the growing refugee settlement of Demacia . Attacking from the sky, Aatrox faced off against Demacia's winged protectors; the twins Kayle and Morgana . As the twins fought him in the sky, Aatrox managed to defeat them and marched alongside his army towards Demacia's gates. As a last resort, Morgana tapped into dark magics and summoned magical chains from the ground to restrain Aatrox. While restrained, Kayle fired a blast of holy flames at Aatrox, seemingly defeating him and his army. [ 7 ]\nOn his quest to achieve oblivion and enact vengeance against the Aspects that trapped him, Aatrox travelled to Mount Targon and terrorized armies of barbarians on his way there, driving them into Targonian lands. Seeking to reach the mountain's summit, Aatrox faced off against Pantheon and confronted him in a battle in the skies. Aatrox achieved what was thought impossible and stabbed his sword through Pantheon's chest, wounding him so deeply that he carved the constellation of War out of the cosmos, essentially killing the Aspect. Only the Aspect's host Atreus remained, spitting in Aatrox's face as he sneered and left him to die to his wounds.\nEventually, a fully recovered Atreus returned and stood between Aatrox and an army of barbarians, wielding the now fallen Aspect's dulled spear and shield. Aatrox mocked Atreus for being foolish enough to face him without the powers of Pantheon and fought him, casting Atreus down to his knees. Before striking the killing blow, Atreus managed to awaken the residual celestial power within himself and reignited the powers of Pantheon, leaping into the air and severing Aatrox's sword arm and defeating him. [ 8 ]\nAatrox eventually gained a new host and began a rampage in the northern parts of Valoran , such as the Freljord . [ 9 ] One night, Aatrox flew across a snowstorm and appeared before Tryndamere's clan, who mistook the Darkin for their horned god the 8 Iron Boar . As some of the tribespeople began to kneel and pray, Aatrox immediately began to slaughter them as Tryndamere looked on in horror before raising his blade and attempting to strike. Aatrox swatted the barbarian aside and nearly beat him to death, speaking archaic words and laughing maniacally as he succumbed to his wounds. [ 10 ]\nAatrox in an apocalyptic battle against Xolaani , with Kayle attempting to intervene.\nAfter Xolaani achieved a new 3 host in Ionia , Aatrox sensed her reawakening from continents away. [ 11 ] Aatrox's hatred for Xolaani burned so deeply that he planned to wage a final war against her to bring him oblivion, rallying the rest of the Darkin to join him in Icathia and battle Xolaani. [ 12 ]\nIn Icathia, he faced off against an empowered 7 Xolaani and battled her alongside the other Darkin. However, some of them fell victim to her hemomancy and fought Aatrox against their will. [ 13 ] Mihira , the Aspect of Justice, sensed the cataclysmic battle between the two and descended down to Runeterra with her daughter Kayle to intervene. Kayle and Aatrox fought one another while Xolaani somehow managed to use hemomancy to bend even Mihira to her will, seemingly fusing with the 7 Aspect .\nThough the outcome is unclear, its implied that Ryze , who accompanied Kayle on her mission to intervene, decided to utilize a World Rune to completely neutralize the catastrophe. [ 14 ]\nAatrox's consciousness is imprisoned within his sword; a large red blade with sharp spikes and black organic platting that mimics steel. In the center of the blade close to the handle is Aatrox's beating heart, which constantly pulsates with his life force.\nIn his physical form, Aatrox is incredibly large, standing taller than most mortals and capable of increasing his size by repurposing the bodies of his fallen enemies. His skin is a deep red that gets brighter around his chest and he has organic armor covering various parts of his body including his right arm, back, legs, and head. The armor shell on his head forms a helmet with two horns and on his back are two large wings with fleshy membranes that he often grows to raise himself from the ground and intimidate people.\nIt is unknown what Aatrox looked like in his Ascended form, however it is known that he looked similar to his current form with giant golden wings and shimmering armor.\nAs an Ascended , Aatrox was known as an incredibly noble warrior who was loyal to the Shuriman Empire as he didn't hesitate to aid his fellow Ascended during the Icathian Uprising . After facing the horrors of the Void , Aatrox's mind was horribly scarred and he was forever changed by what he faced during the war, seemingly losing his noble nature.\nDuring the Great Darkin War , Aatrox grew violent and mad from the lack of leadership and purpose. He began disregarded mortal life completely, either seeing them as beneath him or simply as soldiers for his armies. Though he was a ruthless and vicious warrior, he still held a sense of comradery with his fellow Darkin, being an honored general among them. Aatrox had an intense sense of hatred for his enemies, especially those he considers cowards or traitors.\nAfter years trapped in a torturous existence within his sword, Aatrox now speaks vicious rage and constant vindication against life itself, loathing his existence and how far he has fallen from glory. [ 15 ] Aatrox has grown so desperate to end his suffering that he is more than wiling to commit all kinds of atrocities to achieve a proper end, uncaring of who he kills or destroys in the process. Aatrox has a passion for warfare and battle, constantly taunting enemies and going on tangents about the oblivion he wishes to achieve. Despite this, Aatrox can also speak poetically, especially when reminiscing on his current form and the pain of his existence.\nAatrox regards most of his fellow Darkin as his brothers and sisters at arms, being honored among them when he acted as their general during the war . Though he participated in the war and most likely has slain some Darkin in the past, he deeply respects those that remained loyal to him prior to being imprisoned, regarding some of them as old friends and sympathizing with their imprisonment, promising them freedom by joining him on his quest for oblivion. Most recently, Aatrox has rallied most of his Darkin allies to gather in Icathia for a final battle against Xolaani . [ 12 ]\nThe Darkin that Aatrox rallied includes his honored captain Joraal , one of his soldiers named Taarosh , his old friends Praa , Baalkux , Anaakca , Horazi , Naganeka and Styraatu .\nAside from them, Aatrox is implied to be one of five Darkin said to bring ruin to the whole world once they reunite, further implying that they all fought side by side during the war. Though not united, these Darkin are Aatrox himself, Rhaast , Varus , Naafiri and an unknown fifth Darkin. [ 3 ]\nRhaast is regarded as Aatrox's brother, being one of the five Darkin said to have fought alongside Aatrox during the war and destined to reunite and bring ruin to the world. Aatrox does not give Rhaast much respect, as he has yet to fully possesses his current host Shieda Kayn and even criticizes his weapon of choice.\nVarus considers Aatrox his brother and is one of the five Darkin said to have fought alongside him during the war, destined to reunite and bring ruin to the world. Though the two share a desire the bring oblivion to the world, Aatrox considers Varus weak and unbecoming of a Darkin, claiming that he has become too human and succumbing to his mortal emotions, such as his need for revenge.\nIt's implied there was some 'memo' given to Varus by Aatrox which explained that Varus had to use two A's in his name, officially naming him \"Vaarus.\" However, Varus thought the memo was absurd and refused to comply, angering and offending Aatrox.\nNaafiri is one of the five Darkin said to have fought alongside Aatrox during the war, destined to reunite and bring ruin to the world. Because of her eager quest to reunite the rest of the Darkin together, she urges Aatrox to 'focus his rage' and join her in her reunion. Along with that, she actually considers Aatrox stubborn, likely referring to his headstrong mission to bring oblivion to the world.\nAatrox and Xolaani faced off against each other during the Great Darkin War , as Aatrox disagreed with her methods in utilizing her hemomancy talents to manipulate and control all things, including her fellow Darkin. [ 4 ] He saw this as a horrifying and cowardly tactic, considering Xolaani a coward and honing a deep hatred for her. In his rage against Xolaani, Aatrox spent years destroying her statues and removing all influence she had.\nAatrox's hatred for Xolaani ran so deep that he was capable of sensing her reawakening from continents away, rallying the rest of the Darkin to gather in Icathia and face her in a cataclysmic final battle. [ 11 ] When fighting in Icathia, Xolaani managed to use her abilities on some of his Darkin allies, forcing them to fight him against their will. Though the conclusion of the battle isn't clear, it's most likely that Ryze used a World Rune to neutralize the catastrophe and prevent total oblivion.\nAatrox has a deep hatred towards Targon and the Aspects, as they were the ones who ultimately betrayed and imprisoned the Darkin, with Aatrox being the first. At one point, Aatrox sought to enact revenge against the Aspects themselves and possibly achieve oblivion by reaching the summit of Mount Targon , but was ultimately stopped by the 5 Aspect of War .\nWhen the Aspects first began to intervene in the Darkin War, the 5 Aspect of War was sent out to rally armies to fight back against them. Seeing this, Aatrox fought back with an army of his own, clashing in brutal warfare against the Aspect and his mortal armies. In the end, Aatrox was ultimately deceived by the Aspect of Twilight and imprisoned within his sword. Due to this, Aatrox considers Pantheon's battle against him as treachery, calling him a fiend and a betrayer for what he did.\nMany years later, Aatrox sought to reach the peak of Mount Targon and met Pantheon in battle, fighting him in the skies before driving his blade so deeply through him that he carved the constallation of War out of the cosmos, effectively killing the Aspect. When all that remained was the mortal host Atreus , Aatrox sneered and left him to die to his wounds. Soon after, Atreus recovered and fought Aatrox a second time, managing to reignite the constellation of War with his own mortal will and gaining the residual powers of the Aspect. Pantheon severed Aatrox's sword arm and ultimately defeated the Darkin.\nThe two of them continue holding antagonism and animosity for one another long after their battle and wish to destroy one another once and for all one day, with Aatrox wishing to achieve true oblivion and Pantheon seeking to fight against all gods meddling with mortal affairs, including the Darkin. [ 8 ]\nThe Aspect of Twilight is the one responsible for teaching the mortals how to imprison the Darkin within their weapons, starting with Aatrox being the first. The Aspect's host at the time, a girl named Myisha, was the one who orchestrated the process in the first place and was deeply hated by the rest of the Darkin for what she did.\nThough Zoe herself was not responsible for imprisoning the Darkin, Aatrox still holds a disdain for the Aspect no matter who is the current host. Out of all the Aspects, Aatrox wants to kill and torture the Aspect of Twilight the most for what she did, claiming that killing her a thousand times still wouldn't be enough to express his anger towards her.\nAatrox fought against Kayle alongside her sister Morgana when he attempted to raid an early Demacia . He lead a massive army of raiders and defeated the twins in combat before getting restrained by Morgana's ability to summon magical chains. During this, Kayle managed to defeat Aatrox with a wave of holy flames.\nThe two would face each other again during his battle with Xolaani in Icathia, where Kayle and her mother Mihira descend down to Runeterra to intervene in their conflict. While Aatrox and Kayle fought, Mihira was consumed by Xolaani's hemomancy before the entire battle was ultimately neutralized by Ryze.\nAatrox taunts Kayle's celestial heritage, claiming that she is unfit for her ascension to godhood.\nAatrox fought against Morgana alongside her sister Kayle when he attempted to raid an early Demacia. He lead a massive army of raiders and nearly defeated the twins in combat before Morgana tapped into dark magics to restrain Aatrox with magical chains. Aatrox was restrained long enough for Kayle to fire a wave of holy flames at him, defeating him at Demacia's gates.\nAatrox sees Morgana's willingness to embrace her mortality as disgusting, questioning why she would be so eager to bind herself to the mortal realm and threatening to kill her the same way he kills all mortal beings.\nAatrox faced Mihira when she intervened in his battle with Xolaani. Though he sees Mihira as a worthy opponent, he mostly fought her daughter Kayle before Xolaani's hemomancy completely consumed Mihira.\nRyze accompanied Kayle when she and her mother travelled to Icathia to intervene in Aatrox's final war against Xolaani. After meditating on the major events of Runeterra's history, Ryze ultimately decided to use a World Rune to neutralize the cataclysm, narrowly avoiding oblivion.\nAatrox was responsible for decimating most of Tryndamere's tribe after they mistook him as 8 the Iron Boar . Though Tryndamere tried to attack Aatrox for slaughtering his clan, Aatrox swatted him away and beat him nearly to death, speaking archaic words and laughing as he slowly bled to death before miraculously waking up, fully revived by a mysterious power activated by his rage. Tryndamere is deeply scarred by visions of Aatrox laughing maniacally as he slaughtered his people, deeply hating him for what he did.\nIt's heavily implied that Aatrox intends to make Tryndamere his next host body, possibly even being the one who granted him his mysterious abilities after he nearly beat him to death.

Aatrox fought against Pantheon with an army of his own, ultimately losing and becoming deceived as he became one of the first Darkin to become imprisoned. Trapped within his sword in a torturous existence, Aatrox continued to hopelessly reach out of his prison in agony.\nEventually, an unknown mortal man fled a battle and, out of desperation to defend himself, tried to wield Aatrox's sword. Using hemomancy, Aatrox quickly took over this human's body and reformed it as close to his original Ascended form as possible. Fearing that this body was too weak to withstand his Darkin essence, Aatrox looked toward a city caught in the middle of a chaotic battle and planned to slaughter as many mortals as possible and repurpose their corpses to strengthen his new form. [ 6 ]\nAatrox possessed many men and women over the years, learning how to take over a body instantly and feast on his enemies' flesh. Aatrox travelled the world in search of a way to return to his Ascended form but realized that there was no escape from his prison and despaired. With that, Aatrox grew desperate and decided that since he cannot truly free himself from the blade, he would instead end all of existence including himself in a terrible cataclysm. Marching with a new purpose, Aatrox brought war and death wherever he went, hoping to create a battle apocalyptic enough to bring oblivion to everything.\nAt some point, Aatrox gathered and lead a massive army of raiders and lead them to the growing refugee settlement of Demacia . Attacking from the sky, Aatrox faced off against Demacia's winged protectors; the twins Kayle and Morgana . As the twins fought him in the sky, Aatrox managed to defeat them and marched alongside his army towards Demacia's gates. As a last resort, Morgana tapped into dark magics and summoned magical chains from the ground to restrain Aatrox. While restrained, Kayle fired a blast of holy flames at Aatrox, seemingly defeating him and his army. [ 7 ]\nOn his quest to achieve oblivion and enact vengeance against the Aspects that trapped him, Aatrox travelled to Mount Targon and terrorized armies of barbarians on his way there, driving them into Targonian lands. Seeking to reach the mountain's summit, Aatrox faced off against Pantheon and confronted him in a battle in the skies. Aatrox achieved what was thought impossible and stabbed his sword through Pantheon's chest, wounding him so deeply that he carved the constellation of War out of the cosmos, essentially killing the Aspect. Only the Aspect's host Atreus remained, spitting in Aatrox's face as he sneered and left him to die to his wounds.\nEventually, a fully recovered Atreus returned and stood between Aatrox and an army of barbarians, wielding the now fallen Aspect's dulled spear and shield. Aatrox mocked Atreus for being foolish enough to face him without the powers of Pantheon and fought him, casting Atreus down to his knees. Before striking the killing blow, Atreus managed to awaken the residual celestial power within himself and reignited the powers of Pantheon, leaping into the air and severing Aatrox's sword arm and defeating him. [ 8 ]\nAatrox eventually gained a new host and began a rampage in the northern parts of Valoran , such as the Freljord . [ 9 ] One night, Aatrox flew across a snowstorm and appeared before Tryndamere's clan, who mistook the Darkin for their horned god the 8 Iron Boar . As some of the tribespeople began to kneel and pray, Aatrox immediately began to slaughter them as Tryndamere looked on in horror before raising his blade and attempting to strike. Aatrox swatted the barbarian aside and nearly beat him to death, speaking archaic words and laughing maniacally as he succumbed to his wounds. [ 10 ]\nAatrox in an apocalyptic battle against Xolaani , with Kayle attempting to intervene.\nAfter Xolaani achieved a new 3 host in Ionia , Aatrox sensed her reawakening from continents away. [ 11 ] Aatrox's hatred for Xolaani burned so deeply that he planned to wage a final war against her to bring him oblivion, rallying the rest of the Darkin to join him in Icathia and battle Xolaani. [ 12 ]\nIn Icathia, he faced off against an empowered 7 Xolaani and battled her alongside the other Darkin. However, some of them fell victim to her hemomancy and fought Aatrox against their will. [ 13 ] Mihira , the Aspect of Justice, sensed the cataclysmic battle between the two and descended down to Runeterra with her daughter Kayle to intervene. Kayle and Aatrox fought one another while Xolaani somehow managed to use hemomancy to bend even Mihira to her will, seemingly fusing with the 7 Aspect .\nThough the outcome is unclear, its implied that Ryze , who accompanied Kayle on her mission to intervene, decided to utilize a World Rune to completely neutralize the catastrophe. [ 14 ]\nAatrox's consciousness is imprisoned within his sword; a large red blade with sharp spikes and black organic platting that mimics steel. In the center of the blade close to the handle is Aatrox's beating heart, which constantly pulsates with his life force.\nIn his physical form, Aatrox is incredibly large, standing taller than most mortals and capable of increasing his size by repurposing the bodies of his fallen enemies. His skin is a deep red that gets brighter around his chest and he has organic armor covering various parts of his body including his right arm, back, legs, and head. The armor shell on his head forms a helmet with two horns and on his back are two large wings with fleshy membranes that he often grows to raise himself from the ground and intimidate people.\nIt is unknown what Aatrox looked like in his Ascended form, however it is known that he looked similar to his current form with giant golden wings and shimmering armor.\nAs an Ascended , Aatrox was known as an incredibly noble warrior who was loyal to the Shuriman Empire as he didn't hesitate to aid his fellow Ascended during the Icathian Uprising . After facing the horrors of the Void , Aatrox's mind was horribly scarred and he was forever changed by what he faced during the war, seemingly losing his noble nature.\nDuring the Great Darkin War , Aatrox grew violent and mad from the lack of leadership and purpose. He began disregarded mortal life completely, either seeing them as beneath him or simply as soldiers for his armies. Though he was a ruthless and vicious warrior, he still held a sense of comradery with his fellow Darkin, being an honored general among them. Aatrox had an intense sense of hatred for his enemies, especially those he considers cowards or traitors.\nAfter years trapped in a torturous existence within his sword, Aatrox now speaks vicious rage and constant vindication against life itself, loathing his existence and how far he has fallen from glory. [ 15 ] Aatrox has grown so desperate to end his suffering that he is more than wiling to commit all kinds of atrocities to achieve a proper end, uncaring of who he kills or destroys in the process. Aatrox has a passion for warfare and battle, constantly taunting enemies and going on tangents about the oblivion he wishes to achieve. Despite this, Aatrox can also speak poetically, especially when reminiscing on his current form and the pain of his existence.\nAatrox regards most of his fellow Darkin as his brothers and sisters at arms, being honored among them when he acted as their general during the war . Though he participated in the war and most likely has slain some Darkin in the past, he deeply respects those that remained loyal to him prior to being imprisoned, regarding some of them as old friends and sympathizing with their imprisonment, promising them freedom by joining him on his quest for oblivion. Most recently, Aatrox has rallied most of his Darkin allies to gather in Icathia for a final battle against Xolaani . [ 12 ]\nThe Darkin that Aatrox rallied includes his honored captain Joraal , one of his soldiers named Taarosh , his old friends Praa , Baalkux , Anaakca , Horazi , Naganeka and Styraatu .\nAside from them, Aatrox is implied to be one of five Darkin said to bring ruin to the whole world once they reunite, further implying that they all fought side by side during the war. Though not united, these Darkin are Aatrox himself, Rhaast , Varus , Naafiri and an unknown fifth Darkin. [ 3 ]\nRhaast is regarded as Aatrox's brother, being one of the five Darkin said to have fought alongside Aatrox during the war and destined to reunite and bring ruin to the world. Aatrox does not give Rhaast much respect, as he has yet to fully possesses his current host Shieda Kayn and even criticizes his weapon of choice.\nVarus considers Aatrox his brother and is one of the five Darkin said to have fought alongside him during the war, destined to reunite and bring ruin to the world. Though the two share a desire the bring oblivion to the world, Aatrox considers Varus weak and unbecoming of a Darkin, claiming that he has become too human and succumbing to his mortal emotions, such as his need for revenge.\nIt's implied there was some 'memo' given to Varus by Aatrox which explained that Varus had to use two A's in his name, officially naming him \"Vaarus.\" However, Varus thought the memo was absurd and refused to comply, angering and offending Aatrox.\nNaafiri is one of the five Darkin said to have fought alongside Aatrox during the war, destined to reunite and bring ruin to the world. Because of her eager quest to reunite the rest of the Darkin together, she urges Aatrox to 'focus his rage' and join her in her reunion. Along with that, she actually considers Aatrox stubborn, likely referring to his headstrong mission to bring oblivion to the world.\nAatrox and Xolaani faced off against each other during the Great Darkin War , as Aatrox disagreed with her methods in utilizing her hemomancy talents to manipulate and control all things, including her fellow Darkin. [ 4 ] He saw this as a horrifying and cowardly tactic, considering Xolaani a coward and honing a deep hatred for her. In his rage against Xolaani, Aatrox spent years destroying her statues and removing all influence she had.\nAatrox's hatred for Xolaani ran so deep that he was capable of sensing her reawakening from continents away, rallying the rest of the Darkin to gather in Icathia and face her in a cataclysmic final battle. [ 11 ] When fighting in Icathia, Xolaani managed to use her abilities on some of his Darkin allies, forcing them to fight him against their will. Though the conclusion of the battle isn't clear, it's most likely that Ryze used a World Rune to neutralize the catastrophe and prevent total oblivion.\nAatrox has a deep hatred towards Targon and the Aspects, as they were the ones who ultimately betrayed and imprisoned the Darkin, with Aatrox being the first. At one point, Aatrox sought to enact revenge against the Aspects themselves and possibly achieve oblivion by reaching the summit of Mount Targon , but was ultimately stopped by the 5 Aspect of War .\nWhen the Aspects first began to intervene in the Darkin War, the 5 Aspect of War was sent out to rally armies to fight back against them. Seeing this, Aatrox fought back with an army of his own, clashing in brutal warfare against the Aspect and his mortal armies. In the end, Aatrox was ultimately deceived by the Aspect of Twilight and imprisoned within his sword. Due to this, Aatrox considers Pantheon's battle against him as treachery, calling him a fiend and a betrayer for what he did.\nMany years later, Aatrox sought to reach the peak of Mount Targon and met Pantheon in battle, fighting him in the skies before driving his blade so deeply through him that he carved the constallation of War out of the cosmos, effectively killing the Aspect. When all that remained was the mortal host Atreus , Aatrox sneered and left him to die to his wounds. Soon after, Atreus recovered and fought Aatrox a second time, managing to reignite the constellation of War with his own mortal will and gaining the residual powers of the Aspect. Pantheon severed Aatrox's sword arm and ultimately defeated the Darkin.\nThe two of them continue holding antagonism and animosity for one another long after their battle and wish to destroy one another once and for all one day, with Aatrox wishing to achieve true oblivion and Pantheon seeking to fight against all gods meddling with mortal affairs, including the Darkin. [ 8 ]\nThe Aspect of Twilight is the one responsible for teaching the mortals how to imprison the Darkin within their weapons, starting with Aatrox being the first. The Aspect's host at the time, a girl named Myisha, was the one who orchestrated the process in the first place and was deeply hated by the rest of the Darkin for what she did.\nThough Zoe herself was not responsible for imprisoning the Darkin, Aatrox still holds a disdain for the Aspect no matter who is the current host. Out of all the Aspects, Aatrox wants to kill and torture the Aspect of Twilight the most for what she did, claiming that killing her a thousand times still wouldn't be enough to express his anger towards her.\nAatrox fought against Kayle alongside her sister Morgana when he attempted to raid an early Demacia . He lead a massive army of raiders and defeated the twins in combat before getting restrained by Morgana's ability to summon magical chains. During this, Kayle managed to defeat Aatrox with a wave of holy flames.\nThe two would face each other again during his battle with Xolaani in Icathia, where Kayle and her mother Mihira descend down to Runeterra to intervene in their conflict. While Aatrox and Kayle fought, Mihira was consumed by Xolaani's hemomancy before the entire battle was ultimately neutralized by Ryze.\nAatrox taunts Kayle's celestial heritage, claiming that she is unfit for her ascension to godhood.\nAatrox fought against Morgana alongside her sister Kayle when he attempted to raid an early Demacia. He lead a massive army of raiders and nearly defeated the twins in combat before Morgana tapped into dark magics to restrain Aatrox with magical chains. Aatrox was restrained long enough for Kayle to fire a wave of holy flames at him, defeating him at Demacia's gates.\nAatrox sees Morgana's willingness to embrace her mortality as disgusting, questioning why she would be so eager to bind herself to the mortal realm and threatening to kill her the same way he kills all mortal beings.\nAatrox faced Mihira when she intervened in his battle with Xolaani. Though he sees Mihira as a worthy opponent, he mostly fought her daughter Kayle before Xolaani's hemomancy completely consumed Mihira.\nRyze accompanied Kayle when she and her mother travelled to Icathia to intervene in Aatrox's final war against Xolaani. After meditating on the major events of Runeterra's history, Ryze ultimately decided to use a World Rune to neutralize the cataclysm, narrowly avoiding oblivion.\nAatrox was responsible for decimating most of Tryndamere's tribe after they mistook him as 8 the Iron Boar . Though Tryndamere tried to attack Aatrox for slaughtering his clan, Aatrox swatted him away and beat him nearly to death, speaking archaic words and laughing as he slowly bled to death before miraculously waking up, fully revived by a mysterious power activated by his rage. Tryndamere is deeply scarred by visions of Aatrox laughing maniacally as he slaughtered his people, deeply hating him for what he did.\nIt's heavily implied that Aatrox intends to make Tryndamere his next host body, possibly even being the one who granted him his mysterious abilities after he nearly beat him to death.

Having become a somewhat reluctant and empathetic predator since entering mortal society, she prefers to manipulate her prey's emotions before partaking of their life essence —receiving flashes of memory and insight from each soul she consumes.\nAhri's earliest memories are of her growing up among a pack of icefoxes in northern Shon-Xan . Though her true origins are unknown even to her, she was accepted by the pack and considered one of them. Though she was a vastaya , she had no knowledge of her tribe except for a pair of sunstones she carried her entire life.\nLiving in the wild among the icefoxes, Ahri began to feel her vastayan abilities surface as she found she was capable of channeling the Spirit Realm within herself, gaining the ability to enhance her in reflexes and control the emotions of her prey.\nA drawing of Ahri when she was found bathing by the Piltovan explorer Eduard Santangelo. [ 1 ]\nAhri often watched humans from afar for years until she found one wounded by a stray arrow. Ahri found she could feel his life force seeping away and followed her predatorial instincts, absorbing his spiritual essence and feasting on his memories, emotions and knowledge on human language. As she grew closer to the fringes of Ionian society, Ahri became addicted to feeding off of the spiritual essence of mortals, becoming drunk on their emotions and stolen memories. Eventually Ahri saw memories depicting how humans perceived her; a terrifying monster. Distressed by this, Ahri tried to stop from feeding on mortal essence but realized her powers slowly faded if she did, deciding to fully embrace her nature as a monster.\nOne day, Ahri met an artist who, instead of running away from her in fear, actually offered his own essence in exchange for her love. For the first time, Ahri felt genuine happiness without having to feed on spiritual essence and the two fell in love. Though Ahri pleaded that she was too monstrous for him, the artist explained that he loved her wholly despite her monstrous nature. The two would often sit by a lake at the edge of Ionia, as Ahri blissfully watched her lover paint pictures of flowers. Unfortunately, Ahri lost control of her ravenous instincts one day and completely drained her lover, killing him. Ahri despaired over this and mourned the loss of the first and only person she truly loved, retreating further even from society.\nAhri at the Garden of Forgetting attempting to use a snow lily flower to remove her traumatic memories of her dead lover.\nGrief stricken over the loss of her lover, Ahri retreated from society and travelled to the Garden of Forgetting . Here, she wished to erase all the troubled memories she stole during her time as a predator, especially those of her dead lover.\nHere she met a mysterious old woman tending to the garden. Ahri recognized this woman as the garden's caretaker, known by names such as the Eater of Secrets, the Forgotten or the Witch Gardener. Ahri referred to her as Ighilya, the Ionian word for \"great grandmother,\" and begged her to show her how to forget the painful memories of her lover. The Gardener warned her that forgetting these memories was a worse fate, but reluctantly agreed to help Ahri, handing her a budding snow lily and instructing her to breath into the flower and think of the memory she wanted to get rid of. The flower, while trying to consume the memory, caused Ahri to relive the death of her lover through painful visions, making Ahri realize that she didn't want to lose these memories of her beloved as removing them was far worse than living with the pain.\nAttempting to pull away, Ahri felt suffocated by the unnatural perfumes of the snow lily and saw hallucinogenic visions appear as a result of it. After hallucinating in the garden, she regained her senses as the Gardener stood above her, asking her if she managed to keep the memory before the flower took hold. Ahri explained that she did, despite it seeming cloudy, as the Gardener quietly urged Ahri to leave the garden before it takes her, as it did with many others who visited it before. As dark vines and snow lilies began to overgrow and cover the exits out of the garden, Ahri managed to escape with her vastayan reflexes and decided that she would from now on live from her past pains and experiences rather than regret and attempt to forget them. [ 2 ]\nWishing to find a solution to control her abilities and her predatory instincts, Ahri became consumed with learning more about her origins and her mysterious vastayan tribe. Her travels through Ionia eventually lead her to Omikayalan , the once sacred grove of the God-Willow; a legendary and magical tree that had been cut down thousands of years ago.\nAhri at the grove of Omikayalan , unknowingly being followed by the vastayan lord 4 Himon'she\nThere she met several spiritual creatures that protected 3 a God-Willow sapling , including vastayan lords such as 4 Himon'she , 5 Gai'sh , 5 the Tail-Cloak Matriarch and a mighty fox spirit named 7 Sai'nen Thousand-Tailed . Here, Ahri learned to embrace her wild vastayan nature, continuing her search for her lost tribe and leaving the sacred grove.\nOn her search for her lost tribe, Ahri travelled to an Ionian market, taking in the new environment. A fortune teller named Hirin approached Ahri and recognized her twin sunstones as the work of a talented artisan named Ymelo. Curious, as these sunstones were her only link to her lost tribe, Ahri asked the fortune teller more details about Ymelo as the two conversed in her caravan. Offering Ahri tea, Hirin proceeded to tell Ahri what she knew about Ymelo, explaining how he was a master sculptor known for collecting fossilized lizard eggs and carving them into intricate shapes. Ahri's sunstones were a very particular beauty to Hirin, as she explained that his stones were typically built to be small pieces fitting into a larger sculpture.\nAs the conversation went on, Hirin pulled out a hunting knife and revealed that she slipped a paralysis potion into Ahri's tea, leaving Ahri unable to move or pounce as her limbs completely froze. Hirin sought to cut off one of Ahri's tails, as they are a useful ingredient for her potions and seen as extremely valuable.\nDespite being paralyzed, Ahri managed to use her soul-devouring abilities to steal essence from Hirin and make herself strong enough to move again. Enraged, Ahri began to devour Hirin's essence, seeing flashes of her memories and witnessing the hardships she faced in life. Empathizing with the fortune teller, Ahri decided to spare her life, devouring the memories of their encounter and leaving Hirin to forget what just happened. Ahri then left the market with a new lead to follow on her quest; the craftsman Ymelo. [ 3 ]\nAt some point, Ahri found more clues about Ymelo that required her to travel to the pirate city Bilgewater . In order to do so however, Ahri realized that she needed a bodyguard to escort her overseas. Travelling to Weh'le during a Spirit Blossom festival, Ahri found her self at a local teahouse in search of anybody willing to act as her protecting in Bilgewater.\nOverhearing a conversation about Noxian warriors living in the village, Ahri became curious and asked where she can find a mighty warrior like these Noxians to serve as her guard. Paskoma, the teahouse's owner, immediately denied Ahri and refused to allow anybody dangerous to stay in her house, insisting that Ahri leave if she intends to bring in a warrior. Ahri didn't want to stay at a different teahouse and agreed to respect Paskoma's wishes before disappearing into her room.\nDuring the first night of the Spirit Blossom festival, a massive feast was hosted at the teahouse as even Ahri decided to join in on the festivities. During the dinner, Ahri talked with Paskoma's granddaughter Satokka, who mistook Ahri's fox-like appearance as a costume of the Gatekeeper ; a mythological Ionian spirit known for guiding the dead souls during the festival. The two got in a heated discussed over Ionian culture and mythology, most notably about a spirit named the Taker . As Paskoma's spouse Ituren began to serve desert to the teahouse guests, Ahri used her mind altering abilities to convince him to let warriors in the teahouse. [ 4 ]\nAt some point, Ahri met Yasuo ; a lone swordsman in search of a purpose outside of Ionia. They both wanted to find things outside of their homeland, so Ahri managed to persuade Yasuo into accompanying her to Bilgewater, officially hiring him as her bodyguard. Though the two set sail and traveled together, Ahri kept her vastayan nature and identity a secret from Yasuo. [ 5 ]\nAs the two finally arrived in the pirate city, Ahri traveled to a black market and spoke to one of their vendors. Asking about her tribe, now knowing them as the Vesani , Ahri learned that a Vesani sunstone was recently purchased by a member of the Jagged Hooks named Malik, who was headed towards Grey Harbor. Overtime though, Yasuo grew more frustrated as Ahri refused to explain her mission and reveal her true nature to him. Deciding to search for the pirate tomorrow, the two stayed the night at a local tavern where Yasuo finally deduced Ahri's true nature as a vastaya as she revealed her mission to him. That night, after having a nightmare of her former lover, Ahri feared the same thing would happen to Yasuo and left for Grey Harbor alone, managing to track down and interrogate one of the Jagged Hooks. Here, she discovered that the pirate king Gangplank actually took the sunstone and set off for the Shadow Isles .\nIn pursuit of the sunstone, Ahri traveled to the Shadow Isles by herself, leaving her cloak behind in the forst. Here, she encountered and befriended the nature spirit Maokai , who explained his origins as a spirit that once helped the Blessed Isles flourish with life before the Ruination of Helia . Searching for Gangplank, Maokai revealed that he actually allied himself with the wicked wraith Thresh , using his artifacts to stir the mist and causing it to form impenetrable walls and weaken Maokai by infecting his roots within the Vesani vaults below the isles, who she discovered had traveled to the Blessed Isles long before the Ruination.\nAhri along the rest of the crew of the Charming Lady, consisting of her bodyguard Yasuo, Illaoi , their captain Sarah Fortune , Pyke and Braum .\nYasuo arrived on the Shadow Isles as part of the crew of the Charming Lady, accompanied by Braum , Illaoi , Pyke and their captain Sarah Fortune . The group faced off against a threatened Maokai before Ahri intervened, clearing the air and explaining the situation that Maokai shared with her. As the crew also wanted to find Gangplank, they realized he would most likely be in Thresh's fortress which was being protected by walls of the Black Mist. Ahri planned on heading to one of the Vesani vaults in search of more evidence, but the others insisted on accompanying her to cleanse Maokai's roots to which she reluctantly agreed.\nThe crew pushed back the Black Mist infesting the vault while Ahri slowly gained more knowledge and clues about her ancestors, discovering that they had a deep connection to the Shadow Isles and created technology based around preserving memories. Though they managed to cleanse Maokai's roots, he would regain his strength slowly and remained too weak to immediately help clear out the mist. Instead, the group planned to travel to a an undersea temple of the Buhru as Maokai gave Illaoi one of his seeds to be blessed by her god Nagakabouros , allowing him to quickly restore his grove and clear out the mist.\nAfter Pyke managed to locate the deep undersea temple and Illaoi convinced the Buhru serpent callers to tame the sea monsters guarding it, the crew traveled into the undersea temple and found a place to purify the seed of the Black Mist and bless it. Ahri, using her powers to aid in the process, nearly lost control of herself due to the Black Mist corruption within the seed before regaining her sanity. With the seed now successfully blessed, the crew sailed back to the Shadow Isles to return it to Maokai.\nOn their way to Maokai's grove, the crew met an undead shade named Necrit , revealed to be the former advisor of Viego , the Ruined King of Camavor . Necrit explains and reveals the true, unknown origins of the Shadow Isles and how it was formed by the broken heart of Viego after the tragic death of his wife Isolde . Finally, Necrit warned the crew that Thresh's grand plan is to use artifacts of power to reawaken Viego from the mist before bidding them farewell and urging them to stop Thresh's ritual.\nWith Maokai reinvigorated by the purified seed, he managed to clear out the walls of mist and expose Thresh's fortress, allowing the crew to enter. Inside Thresh's Library of Agony, Ahri found Thresh's collection of Vesani artifacts, as well as Gangplank's sunstone which she discovered was a vessel used to contain memories. However, the sunstone seemed depleted and drained with only some residual memories of her ancestors. Wishing to examine it more, Ahri took the sunstone for safekeeping. The crew eventually manage to find Thresh and defeat him in battle, returning him to the Black Mist.\nNow searching for Gangplank, the crew travelled to the heart of the Shadow Isles hoping to stop him but arrive too late, as Gangplank has already reawakened Viego. Though he attempted to capture Viego within a Buhru artifact, he fails and becomes possessed by the Ruined King as he flies towards Bilgewater alongside a violent Harrowing in search of his dead wife's crown . Forced to fight the crew under Viego's control, Gangplank was defeated and imprisoned on Sarah Fortune's ship. Meanwhile, Ahri managed to sense something lingering in the Black Mist and receieved visions of Viego's discarded memories, seeing the negative parts of his marriage and learning the truth; that his love for his wife was not as pure as he tells himself.\nIn order to pursue Viego, Yasuo volunteered to channel the wind into the sails and Ahri empowered him with her own magic. While Illaoi interrogates Gangplank for a way to defeat Viego, he reveals that the discarded memories discovered by Ahri would most likely be capable of weakening Viego enough to be defeated. Though they managed to reach Viego, he sends out a gale of Black Mist, shipwrecking the crew on a mysterious island with mystical winds. Here, Yasuo became haunted by visions of his past and confronted a shadow resembling his dead brother . Seeing Yasuo's past play in action, Ahri began to empathize with him and shared her own grief over her dead lover, allowing him to defeat the shadow and overcome his past. The ship is eventually repaired, allowing them to make it back to Bilgewater in time to prepare them for Viego's Harrowing.\nThe crew make a plan to have Ahri weaken Viego with his own discarded memories and imprison him within Gangplank's Buhru amulet, but it had been corrupted and damaged in the fight. Learning about an ancient Buhru forge located underneath the Shadow Isles, the crew plan to take the amulet there to have it repaired. Once they land at the Shadow Isles, they are once again confronted by Necrit, who revealed that the forge is located inside a Vesani vault with more evidence of Ahri's ancestors. Inside the vault, Ahri channeled the memories within her twin sunstones and learned that her people were a nomadic tribe of vastaya that specialized in studying magic relating to memories. Their nomadic lifestyle brought them to the Blessed Isles, where they became allies with the city of Helia and began to study the ethereal Hallowed Mist that once protected the isles, learning to harness its power to enchant golems, technologies and other artifacts such as Ahri's sunstones. The Vesani however became victims of the terrible Ruination of Helia that ultimately created the Shadow Isles.\nAfter finding a facility capable of transferring memories into sunstones, Ahri planned to transfer all the research preserved by her Vesani ancestors into a sunstone and finally achieve the answers she had been looking for. However, she is eventually forced to make a decision; should she use the sunstone as a vessel to hold the memories of her people or to house Viego's discarded memories as a means to weaken him? Ahri, knowing what's at stake for the world, chose to store Viego's memories, causing the memories of her ancestors to fade away. Despairing over the loss, Ahri was suddenly faced with a memory of her dead lover, who forgave her for what she did. He explained that her memories will always be with her, but that it's more important to allow yourself to create new memories rather than dwell on old ones. He urges Ahri to keep fighting and to help save the world before finally fading away as Ahri thanks him for the closure.\nAs the crew managed to find the Buhru forge underneath the vault, Ahri joined the rest of the group as they bore their souls before Nagakabouros herself, battling the goddess's avatar and being found worthy of her help as the goddess cleanses the amulet.\nNow back at Bilgewater, the crew finally battled the Ruined King while Ahri, wielding the sunstone containing his discarded memories, used her magic to weaken Viego, forcing him to remember the twisted parts of his love for Isolde. Once beaten, Ahri hit him with more of his memories, forcing him to relive his death when an angered wraith of Isolde killed him at the Blessed Isles. While distracted, Sarah Fortune used the opportunity to imprison Viego within the amulet. Though he nearly corrupted her soul and tempted her to follow him in the process, she was ultimately successful as the Ruined King was finally banished.\nWith the battle over, Ahri celebrated with her new friends at the Baron's Rest tavern, where each member of the group talked about their future plans now that Viego had been defeated. Ahri revealed that she plans on returning to the Shadow Isles, wishing to see what else she can learn from her ancestors and dedicating herself to living in their footsteps by bringing life and new memories to the world. [ 6 ]\nAhri is an attractive female Vesani of medium stature with pale skin and long black hair down to her back tied in a braid with two long strands sticking out on the sides in her face. Her eyes are golden yellow with slit-shaped pupils and her cheeks have red, whisker-like marks on them. Due to her vastayan nature, she has black fox ears atop her head, long claws for nails and nine white fox tails. She usually wears a white dress with red and gold details as well as trinkets such as three purple tassels.\nAt times, usually when hiding her vastayan nature among society to stop from unwanted attention, Ahri wears a giant white hooded cloak to shield not only her face but also her nine white tails.\nAhri started out as very savage and impulsive, growing up in the wilds away from civilization and becoming obsessed with consuming the spiritual essence of mortals. As she devoured more souls, she began to feel the emotions of her victims and became more empathetic and reluctant to continue her hunts. After the death of her lover, Ahri became consumed with regret and guilt, completely ashamed of her Vesani nature and distancing herself completely from society, only ever interacting with people to feast on their essence and sate her hunger. Ahri's pain grew so large that she simply wanted to forget all the painful memories, but ultimately decided that these memories were too valuable to let go of learned to carry her memories with her, no matter how painful they are.\nThough deceivingly old and wise with the knowledge of the many memories she had consumed over the years, Ahri carries a youthful demeanor with a witty, mischievous and even flirty attitude. Although she remains somewhat moody and impulsive, sometimes losing control of her ravenous hunger, she has become incredibly empathetic with her abilities to consume emotions, even empathizing with those that would wish her harm. After choosing to cleanse the memories of her ancestors from her sunstones, Ahri found closure with her past and now lives to uphold the wisdoms of the Vesani by looking towards the future and allowing herself to make new memories instead of dwelling on her old ones.\nSince childhood, Ahri has observed human civilization from afar until she encountered a hunter dying from a stray arrow. Curiously sensing his fading life force, Ahri got her first taste of spiritual essence and absorbed the man's memories, gaining all his knowledge and experiences. Since then, Ahri hunted down human prey for years, drunkenly drinking their essence and learning to manipulate them with her charms.\nShe slowly felt a sense of regret as she grew empathetic from absorbing human emotions, eventually seeing how they perceived her as a monstrous fox demon. Despite this, Ahri accepted her monstrous nature and continued to feast on human essence. It wasn't until she met her first and only love, a human artist, that she began to feel true sympathy for humans and decided to completely Now, after befriending Yasuo and the rest of Sarah Fortune's crew, she feels a deep sense of empathy and sympathy or her prey, sparing them from her hunger by learning to control it.\nYears ago, Ahri fell in love with a human artist who remains as her first and only true love. Unlike the rest of Ahri's prey, the artist was the first person to willingly offer his essence to Ahri in exchange for her love, to which she agreed. From there, she felt true happiness for the first time as the two would often lay in a lake at the edge of Ionia. Unfortunately, Ahri lost control of her hunger one day and accidentally drained her lover completely, thoroughly killing him.\nFor years Ahri lived in constant regret over the death of her lover and attempted to remove the memories of him entirely at the Garden of Forgetting . In the process though, Ahri realized that her memories of her lover were too valuable to simply let go of and decided to live with them, no matter how painful it is to remember.\nAhri finally found closure with the death of her lover when she cleansed the memories of her ancestors from the sunstones at the Buhru forge. In the process of this, Ahri sorrowed over the loss of the memories of her ancestors but was confronted with a memory of her lover, who urged Ahri to fight for the future and told her to live life to create new memories instead of dwelling on her old ones. This interaction defined Ahri, allowing her to live as she does now, as a protector of life in the same vein as her Vesani ancestors.\nHirin was a fortune teller that Ahri encountered in an Ionian market during her search for clues about her long-lost vastayan tribe. The fortune teller recognized Ahri's mysterious set of twin sunstones as the work of Ymelo, which intrigued Ahri as she agreed to enter her caravan for tea and to discuss more about her stones. Hirin revealed everything she knew about Ymelo to Ahri, before pulling out a hunting knife and revealing that she had put a paralysis potion in Ahri's cup of tea. Wishing to cut off one of her tails as an ingredient for her potions, Ahri managed to absorb enough of Hirin's essence to regain her strength and defend herself. Though she was furious at the betrayal, she looked into Hirin's memories and hardships in life, deciding to spare her life and leaving her without any memory of their encounter, essentially making her forget Ahri completely.\nThe Gardener is the mysterious caretaker of the Garden of Forgetting , also known as Ighilya by Ahri. The Gardener seems to be a person with some magical affinity rumored to be a witch of some sorts and offered Ahri guidance when she arrived to the garden with regret and sorrows over her dead lover. Though Ahri desperately begged the Gardener to help her forget these painful memories, she was reluctant to help her and urged her to live life with the pain and attempting to convince her that forgetting is much worse than living with the pain. As Ahri was in the process of feeding her memories to a snow lily given to her by the Gardener, she finally took her advice and refused to forget, believing that her memories of her lover were too valuable to forget. When the garden attempted to trap Ahri for interrupting the process, the Gardener quietly warned Ahri to leave before it was too late, allowing her to escape.\nYmelo is the famed sculptor said to have created Ahri's twin sunstones as well as many others. Though who his true origins are unknown, he's famed across the world for his ability to carve ancient fossilized eggs into intricate shapes and often creates small artifacts as pieces of larger sculptors. After learning of Ymelo, Ahri found clues leading her to Bilgewater, where she confronted a vendor at a black market and tried finding another of his sculptors, which the vendor sold to Malik of the Jagged Hooks .\nThe Vesani are Ahri's long-lost vastayan tribe. Since her childhood, Ahri was completely unaware of their existence and lived lost and questioning her origins. After embracing her nature as a vastaya, Ahri dedicated herself in finding clues about her Vesani ancestors, hoping that she could learn how to control her insatiable hunger for spiritual essence.\nHer quest eventually lead her to the Shadow Isles , where she discovered the deep history the Vesani have with the now cursed Blessed Isles. By delving into their many vaults across the isles, studying their artifacts and sensing the memories left over by her people, Ahri learned that the Vesani were a nomadic tribe that traveled to the Blessed Isles and allied themselves with the Helians , becoming experts on magic related to memories.\nWhen Ahri was forced to decide between containing the collected knowledge of her ancestors or the discarded memories of the Ruined King , she decided the latter and saw the memories of her people fade away. Mourning this, she was confronted by a memory of her long dead lover, who urged Ahri to fight for the future instead of dwelling on the past. With this, Ahri dedicates herself to upholding the teachings of the Vesani, becoming a protector of life and memories, looking to the future and creating new memories to honor her ancestors.\nThe crew of the Charming Lady is a group that come together in order to stop Viego and confront the Black Mist. Throughout their journey, Ahri forms a bond based on their shared experiences. This crew consisted of Braum , Illaoi , Pyke , Yasuo , Ahri and was led by Sarah Fortune\nSarah Fortune is the captain of the Charming Lady and acts as the leader of the crew. Though she was initially distrustful of Ahri due to the fact that she fed on some of her crewmates' essences, she learned to trust and respect Ahri's powers after the crew found her in the Shadow Isles . Sarah is somewhat intimidated by Ahri's abilities, most notably her ability to absorb life essence and manipulate peoples' emotions, but she also respects them, often stating how she's jealous of Ahri's abilities to read people so easily and that she considers herself lucky to have Ahri on their side. The two eventually share even more respect for one another, as Ahri realizes the struggle Sarah faces when trying to maintain control of Bilgewater and Sarah respects Ahri's capability of restraining her hunger for spiritual essence.\nThe two were instrumental in defeating Viego together, as Ahri used the memories contained within her sunstone while Sarah proceeded to use the Buhru amulet on the weakened Ruined King.\nBraum was a member of the crew of the Charming Lady, having been the one who named the vessel in the first place. When the two first meet, Ahri admits that she initially assumed Braum was a troll when they first met due to his massive stature, which makes Braum laugh. The two become quick friends, as Ahri is one of the few on the crew that finds his boundless optimism and 'spirited' nature entertaining. Braum eventually confides in Ahri about Yasuo's unwavering dedication to protect her, which flatters Ahri and kickstarts her rising relationship with Yasuo as well. The two curiously exchange information about each other's homelands, such as Braum explaining the Iceborn to Ahri and even going so far as to invite her personally to visit the Freljord one day.\nIllaoi was a member of the crew of the Charming Lady and a close ally of Sarah Fortune. When they first find Ahri at the Shadow Isles, Illaoi is the one who suggest they join Ahri on entering the Vesani vaults. Unlike others, Illaoi doesn't share a sense of distrust or even fears Ahri's hunger at all, instead being mostly intrigued of her ability to sense the spirits and memories of the Vesani. Illaoi states to Ahri that she has proven she is worthy of their trust and that is why she has no reason to fear her, which Ahri is both cautioned yet flattered by. As the two empathize on their quests to seek their own truths and places in the universe, Illaoi preaches that she believes that their fates are intertwined and that, as a member of the crew, Ahri can seek the answers she is looking for.\nPyke was a member of the crew of the Charming Lady and joined the rest of the crew on their mission to stop the Ruined King. When they met, Ahri instantly knew that Pyke wasn't entirely human as he bluntly explained his vengeful origins. The two share similarities of having murderous pasts, but Ahri painfully reflects on hers while Pyke simply accepts his nature as a murderer and states Ahri should do the same. The two are also the only seemingly immortal members of the Charming Lady crew, as Pyke tells Ahri that he doesn't care about the future and only wants to find the revenge he's been searching for. Ahri, using her abilities, sees more on Pyke's mind beyond his desire to kill.\nAhri met Yasuo during a Spirit Blossom festival, hiring him to be her bodyguard on her way to Bilgewater . Though she initially kept her distance from him, not even revealing her name let alone her nature as a vastaya, he managed to find out the truth and, though Ahri was reluctant to keep him around, Yasuo still promised to stay by her side and disregarded Ahri's warnings of her ravenous nature. After of her dead lover, Ahri realized that bringing Yasuo was a mistake and instead ran away to continue her quest without him, seeing it as a mercy and a way of keeping Yasuo safe from herself. Despite this, Yasuo refused to fail as a body guard a second time and dedicated himself to finding Ahri, going as far as to join the crew of the Charming Lady on their way to the Shadow Isles .\nAfter they reunite when Ahri joins the crew at the Shadow Isles, the two grew closer as Ahri, regretful for leaving Yasuo, decided to explain herself and revealed why she ran away in the first place. Overtime, the two bond over their shared Ionian heritage and their renewed sense of purpose by travelling outside of their shared homeland. After being shipwrecked on a mysterious island with mystical winds, Ahri witnesses Yasuo confront the shadows of his past and empathies with his trauma, having a similar tragedy happen to her as well. Together, they vow to move past their own grief in favor of a better future.\nYasuo cares deeply for Ahri not only as her protector but also in a more personal way. Ahri on the other hand states that Yasuo reminds her of her dead lover in a few ways, most notably in the way he makes her laugh with his brooding yet witty sense of humor.\nViego sought to resurrect his dead queen Isolde at any cost, risking to plunge the entire world in an endless Harrowing . As a member of the Charming Lady, Ahri joined the rest of the crew in defeating him and preventing his catastrophic plan. Thanks to her unique ability to control memories, Ahri was the one who found Viego's discarded memories of his twisted love, willing to sacrifice the memories of her ancestors within her sunstone in order to contain and weaponize the discarded memories against the Ruined King.\nIn the final battle, Ahri was instrumental in Viego's defeat, clouding his mind with the discarded memories and forcing him to relive them. This weakened him enough to allow the rest of the crew to defeat him as Sarah Fortune imprisoned him within an amulet.\nThresh allied himself with Gangplank as part of his plan to awaken Viego in the Shadow Isles. As part of his plan, Thresh had Gangplank collect a multitude of relics, including a sunstone that Ahri had been chasing after. While exploring his fortress, Ahri finds many Vesani artifacts and knowledge hidden away in Thresh's collection, giving her more clues to her ancestors. Ahri aided the crew in defeating Thresh, forcing him to return to the Black Mist before going after Gangplank next.\nMalik is a member of the Jagged Hooks and a lieutenant of Gangplank . When Ahri was searching for one of Ymelo's sunstones at a black market, she learned that Malik already purchased it and traveled to the Shadow Isles, causing Ahri to follow him. At the Shadow Isles, Malik saw Ahri passed through the isles, as he gave the sunstone to his captain before dying after he released a Shadow Isles mistwraith and was attacked.\nAs part of Thresh's plan to awaken Viego, he sent Gangplank to collect a multitude of artifacts to aid him, including one of the Vesani sunstones. By following various clues and travelling to the Shadow Isles herself, she learns that Gangplank got a hold of the sunstone she was searching for and scoured the isles for him, eventually finding the stone in Thresh's library. Ahri helped the rest of the crew defeat Gangplank when he got possessed by the Ruined King.\nAhri first encounters and befriends Maokai when she travels to the Shadow Isles in search of Gangplank and his sunstone. While in his grove, Ahri is told the origins of the Shadow Isles by Maokai, learning about the gentle caretaker underneath his frightening exterior. Ahri aids the rest of the crew when they try to cleanse his roots to allow him to restore his grove, followed by them blessing one of his seeds to empower him even further."}

Having become a somewhat reluctant and empathetic predator since entering mortal society, she prefers to manipulate her prey's emotions before partaking of their life essence —receiving flashes of memory and insight from each soul she consumes.\nAhri's earliest memories are of her growing up among a pack of icefoxes in northern Shon-Xan . Though her true origins are unknown even to her, she was accepted by the pack and considered one of them. Though she was a vastaya , she had no knowledge of her tribe except for a pair of sunstones she carried her entire life.\nLiving in the wild among the icefoxes, Ahri began to feel her vastayan abilities surface as she found she was capable of channeling the Spirit Realm within herself, gaining the ability to enhance her in reflexes and control the emotions of her prey.\nA drawing of Ahri when she was found bathing by the Piltovan explorer Eduard Santangelo. [ 1 ]\nAhri often watched humans from afar for years until she found one wounded by a stray arrow. Ahri found she could feel his life force seeping away and followed her predatorial instincts, absorbing his spiritual essence and feasting on his memories, emotions and knowledge on human language. As she grew closer to the fringes of Ionian society, Ahri became addicted to feeding off of the spiritual essence of mortals, becoming drunk on their emotions and stolen memories. Eventually Ahri saw memories depicting how humans perceived her; a terrifying monster. Distressed by this, Ahri tried to stop from feeding on mortal essence but realized her powers slowly faded if she did, deciding to fully embrace her nature as a monster.\nOne day, Ahri met an artist who, instead of running away from her in fear, actually offered his own essence in exchange for her love. For the first time, Ahri felt genuine happiness without having to feed on spiritual essence and the two fell in love. Though Ahri pleaded that she was too monstrous for him, the artist explained that he loved her wholly despite her monstrous nature. The two would often sit by a lake at the edge of Ionia, as Ahri blissfully watched her lover paint pictures of flowers. Unfortunately, Ahri lost control of her ravenous instincts one day and completely drained her lover, killing him. Ahri despaired over this and mourned the loss of the first and only person she truly loved, retreating further even from society.\nAhri at the Garden of Forgetting attempting to use a snow lily flower to remove her traumatic memories of her dead lover.\nGrief stricken over the loss of her lover, Ahri retreated from society and travelled to the Garden of Forgetting . Here, she wished to erase all the troubled memories she stole during her time as a predator, especially those of her dead lover.\nHere she met a mysterious old woman tending to the garden. Ahri recognized this woman as the garden's caretaker, known by names such as the Eater of Secrets, the Forgotten or the Witch Gardener. Ahri referred to her as Ighilya, the Ionian word for \"great grandmother,\" and begged her to show her how to forget the painful memories of her lover. The Gardener warned her that forgetting these memories was a worse fate, but reluctantly agreed to help Ahri, handing her a budding snow lily and instructing her to breath into the flower and think of the memory she wanted to get rid of. The flower, while trying to consume the memory, caused Ahri to relive the death of her lover through painful visions, making Ahri realize that she didn't want to lose these memories of her beloved as removing them was far worse than living with the pain.\nAttempting to pull away, Ahri felt suffocated by the unnatural perfumes of the snow lily and saw hallucinogenic visions appear as a result of it. After hallucinating in the garden, she regained her senses as the Gardener stood above her, asking her if she managed to keep the memory before the flower took hold. Ahri explained that she did, despite it seeming cloudy, as the Gardener quietly urged Ahri to leave the garden before it takes her, as it did with many others who visited it before. As dark vines and snow lilies began to overgrow and cover the exits out of the garden, Ahri managed to escape with her vastayan reflexes and decided that she would from now on live from her past pains and experiences rather than regret and attempt to forget them. [ 2 ]\nWishing to find a solution to control her abilities and her predatory instincts, Ahri became consumed with learning more about her origins and her mysterious vastayan tribe. Her travels through Ionia eventually lead her to Omikayalan , the once sacred grove of the God-Willow; a legendary and magical tree that had been cut down thousands of years ago.\nAhri at the grove of Omikayalan , unknowingly being followed by the vastayan lord 4 Himon'she\nThere she met several spiritual creatures that protected 3 a God-Willow sapling , including vastayan lords such as 4 Himon'she , 5 Gai'sh , 5 the Tail-Cloak Matriarch and a mighty fox spirit named 7 Sai'nen Thousand-Tailed . Here, Ahri learned to embrace her wild vastayan nature, continuing her search for her lost tribe and leaving the sacred grove.\nOn her search for her lost tribe, Ahri travelled to an Ionian market, taking in the new environment. A fortune teller named Hirin approached Ahri and recognized her twin sunstones as the work of a talented artisan named Ymelo. Curious, as these sunstones were her only link to her lost tribe, Ahri asked the fortune teller more details about Ymelo as the two conversed in her caravan. Offering Ahri tea, Hirin proceeded to tell Ahri what she knew about Ymelo, explaining how he was a master sculptor known for collecting fossilized lizard eggs and carving them into intricate shapes. Ahri's sunstones were a very particular beauty to Hirin, as she explained that his stones were typically built to be small pieces fitting into a larger sculpture.\nAs the conversation went on, Hirin pulled out a hunting knife and revealed that she slipped a paralysis potion into Ahri's tea, leaving Ahri unable to move or pounce as her limbs completely froze. Hirin sought to cut off one of Ahri's tails, as they are a useful ingredient for her potions and seen as extremely valuable.\nDespite being paralyzed, Ahri managed to use her soul-devouring abilities to steal essence from Hirin and make herself strong enough to move again. Enraged, Ahri began to devour Hirin's essence, seeing flashes of her memories and witnessing the hardships she faced in life. Empathizing with the fortune teller, Ahri decided to spare her life, devouring the memories of their encounter and leaving Hirin to forget what just happened. Ahri then left the market with a new lead to follow on her quest; the craftsman Ymelo. [ 3 ]\nAt some point, Ahri found more clues about Ymelo that required her to travel to the pirate city Bilgewater . In order to do so however, Ahri realized that she needed a bodyguard to escort her overseas. Travelling to Weh'le during a Spirit Blossom festival, Ahri found her self at a local teahouse in search of anybody willing to act as her protecting in Bilgewater.\nOverhearing a conversation about Noxian warriors living in the village, Ahri became curious and asked where she can find a mighty warrior like these Noxians to serve as her guard. Paskoma, the teahouse's owner, immediately denied Ahri and refused to allow anybody dangerous to stay in her house, insisting that Ahri leave if she intends to bring in a warrior. Ahri didn't want to stay at a different teahouse and agreed to respect Paskoma's wishes before disappearing into her room.\nDuring the first night of the Spirit Blossom festival, a massive feast was hosted at the teahouse as even Ahri decided to join in on the festivities. During the dinner, Ahri talked with Paskoma's granddaughter Satokka, who mistook Ahri's fox-like appearance as a costume of the Gatekeeper ; a mythological Ionian spirit known for guiding the dead souls during the festival. The two got in a heated discussed over Ionian culture and mythology, most notably about a spirit named the Taker . As Paskoma's spouse Ituren began to serve desert to the teahouse guests, Ahri used her mind altering abilities to convince him to let warriors in the teahouse. [ 4 ]\nAt some point, Ahri met Yasuo ; a lone swordsman in search of a purpose outside of Ionia. They both wanted to find things outside of their homeland, so Ahri managed to persuade Yasuo into accompanying her to Bilgewater, officially hiring him as her bodyguard. Though the two set sail and traveled together, Ahri kept her vastayan nature and identity a secret from Yasuo. [ 5 ]\nAs the two finally arrived in the pirate city, Ahri traveled to a black market and spoke to one of their vendors. Asking about her tribe, now knowing them as the Vesani , Ahri learned that a Vesani sunstone was recently purchased by a member of the Jagged Hooks named Malik, who was headed towards Grey Harbor. Overtime though, Yasuo grew more frustrated as Ahri refused to explain her mission and reveal her true nature to him. Deciding to search for the pirate tomorrow, the two stayed the night at a local tavern where Yasuo finally deduced Ahri's true nature as a vastaya as she revealed her mission to him. That night, after having a nightmare of her former lover, Ahri feared the same thing would happen to Yasuo and left for Grey Harbor alone, managing to track down and interrogate one of the Jagged Hooks. Here, she discovered that the pirate king Gangplank actually took the sunstone and set off for the Shadow Isles .\nIn pursuit of the sunstone, Ahri traveled to the Shadow Isles by herself, leaving her cloak behind in the forst. Here, she encountered and befriended the nature spirit Maokai , who explained his origins as a spirit that once helped the Blessed Isles flourish with life before the Ruination of Helia . Searching for Gangplank, Maokai revealed that he actually allied himself with the wicked wraith Thresh , using his artifacts to stir the mist and causing it to form impenetrable walls and weaken Maokai by infecting his roots within the Vesani vaults below the isles, who she discovered had traveled to the Blessed Isles long before the Ruination.\nAhri along the rest of the crew of the Charming Lady, consisting of her bodyguard Yasuo, Illaoi , their captain Sarah Fortune , Pyke and Braum .\nYasuo arrived on the Shadow Isles as part of the crew of the Charming Lady, accompanied by Braum , Illaoi , Pyke and their captain Sarah Fortune . The group faced off against a threatened Maokai before Ahri intervened, clearing the air and explaining the situation that Maokai shared with her. As the crew also wanted to find Gangplank, they realized he would most likely be in Thresh's fortress which was being protected by walls of the Black Mist. Ahri planned on heading to one of the Vesani vaults in search of more evidence, but the others insisted on accompanying her to cleanse Maokai's roots to which she reluctantly agreed.\nThe crew pushed back the Black Mist infesting the vault while Ahri slowly gained more knowledge and clues about her ancestors, discovering that they had a deep connection to the Shadow Isles and created technology based around preserving memories. Though they managed to cleanse Maokai's roots, he would regain his strength slowly and remained too weak to immediately help clear out the mist. Instead, the group planned to travel to a an undersea temple of the Buhru as Maokai gave Illaoi one of his seeds to be blessed by her god Nagakabouros , allowing him to quickly restore his grove and clear out the mist.\nAfter Pyke managed to locate the deep undersea temple and Illaoi convinced the Buhru serpent callers to tame the sea monsters guarding it, the crew traveled into the undersea temple and found a place to purify the seed of the Black Mist and bless it. Ahri, using her powers to aid in the process, nearly lost control of herself due to the Black Mist corruption within the seed before regaining her sanity. With the seed now successfully blessed, the crew sailed back to the Shadow Isles to return it to Maokai.\nOn their way to Maokai's grove, the crew met an undead shade named Necrit , revealed to be the former advisor of Viego , the Ruined King of Camavor . Necrit explains and reveals the true, unknown origins of the Shadow Isles and how it was formed by the broken heart of Viego after the tragic death of his wife Isolde . Finally, Necrit warned the crew that Thresh's grand plan is to use artifacts of power to reawaken Viego from the mist before bidding them farewell and urging them to stop Thresh's ritual.\nWith Maokai reinvigorated by the purified seed, he managed to clear out the walls of mist and expose Thresh's fortress, allowing the crew to enter. Inside Thresh's Library of Agony, Ahri found Thresh's collection of Vesani artifacts, as well as Gangplank's sunstone which she discovered was a vessel used to contain memories. However, the sunstone seemed depleted and drained with only some residual memories of her ancestors. Wishing to examine it more, Ahri took the sunstone for safekeeping. The crew eventually manage to find Thresh and defeat him in battle, returning him to the Black Mist.\nNow searching for Gangplank, the crew travelled to the heart of the Shadow Isles hoping to stop him but arrive too late, as Gangplank has already reawakened Viego. Though he attempted to capture Viego within a Buhru artifact, he fails and becomes possessed by the Ruined King as he flies towards Bilgewater alongside a violent Harrowing in search of his dead wife's crown . Forced to fight the crew under Viego's control, Gangplank was defeated and imprisoned on Sarah Fortune's ship. Meanwhile, Ahri managed to sense something lingering in the Black Mist and receieved visions of Viego's discarded memories, seeing the negative parts of his marriage and learning the truth; that his love for his wife was not as pure as he tells himself.\nIn order to pursue Viego, Yasuo volunteered to channel the wind into the sails and Ahri empowered him with her own magic. While Illaoi interrogates Gangplank for a way to defeat Viego, he reveals that the discarded memories discovered by Ahri would most likely be capable of weakening Viego enough to be defeated. Though they managed to reach Viego, he sends out a gale of Black Mist, shipwrecking the crew on a mysterious island with mystical winds. Here, Yasuo became haunted by visions of his past and confronted a shadow resembling his dead brother . Seeing Yasuo's past play in action, Ahri began to empathize with him and shared her own grief over her dead lover, allowing him to defeat the shadow and overcome his past. The ship is eventually repaired, allowing them to make it back to Bilgewater in time to prepare them for Viego's Harrowing.\nThe crew make a plan to have Ahri weaken Viego with his own discarded memories and imprison him within Gangplank's Buhru amulet, but it had been corrupted and damaged in the fight. Learning about an ancient Buhru forge located underneath the Shadow Isles, the crew plan to take the amulet there to have it repaired. Once they land at the Shadow Isles, they are once again confronted by Necrit, who revealed that the forge is located inside a Vesani vault with more evidence of Ahri's ancestors. Inside the vault, Ahri channeled the memories within her twin sunstones and learned that her people were a nomadic tribe of vastaya that specialized in studying magic relating to memories. Their nomadic lifestyle brought them to the Blessed Isles, where they became allies with the city of Helia and began to study the ethereal Hallowed Mist that once protected the isles, learning to harness its power to enchant golems, technologies and other artifacts such as Ahri's sunstones. The Vesani however became victims of the terrible Ruination of Helia that ultimately created the Shadow Isles.\nAfter finding a facility capable of transferring memories into sunstones, Ahri planned to transfer all the research preserved by her Vesani ancestors into a sunstone and finally achieve the answers she had been looking for. However, she is eventually forced to make a decision; should she use the sunstone as a vessel to hold the memories of her people or to house Viego's discarded memories as a means to weaken him? Ahri, knowing what's at stake for the world, chose to store Viego's memories, causing the memories of her ancestors to fade away. Despairing over the loss, Ahri was suddenly faced with a memory of her dead lover, who forgave her for what she did. He explained that her memories will always be with her, but that it's more important to allow yourself to create new memories rather than dwell on old ones. He urges Ahri to keep fighting and to help save the world before finally fading away as Ahri thanks him for the closure.\nAs the crew managed to find the Buhru forge underneath the vault, Ahri joined the rest of the group as they bore their souls before Nagakabouros herself, battling the goddess's avatar and being found worthy of her help as the goddess cleanses the amulet.\nNow back at Bilgewater, the crew finally battled the Ruined King while Ahri, wielding the sunstone containing his discarded memories, used her magic to weaken Viego, forcing him to remember the twisted parts of his love for Isolde. Once beaten, Ahri hit him with more of his memories, forcing him to relive his death when an angered wraith of Isolde killed him at the Blessed Isles. While distracted, Sarah Fortune used the opportunity to imprison Viego within the amulet. Though he nearly corrupted her soul and tempted her to follow him in the process, she was ultimately successful as the Ruined King was finally banished.\nWith the battle over, Ahri celebrated with her new friends at the Baron's Rest tavern, where each member of the group talked about their future plans now that Viego had been defeated. Ahri revealed that she plans on returning to the Shadow Isles, wishing to see what else she can learn from her ancestors and dedicating herself to living in their footsteps by bringing life and new memories to the world. [ 6 ]\nAhri is an attractive female Vesani of medium stature with pale skin and long black hair down to her back tied in a braid with two long strands sticking out on the sides in her face. Her eyes are golden yellow with slit-shaped pupils and her cheeks have red, whisker-like marks on them. Due to her vastayan nature, she has black fox ears atop her head, long claws for nails and nine white fox tails. She usually wears a white dress with red and gold details as well as trinkets such as three purple tassels.\nAt times, usually when hiding her vastayan nature among society to stop from unwanted attention, Ahri wears a giant white hooded cloak to shield not only her face but also her nine white tails.\nAhri started out as very savage and impulsive, growing up in the wilds away from civilization and becoming obsessed with consuming the spiritual essence of mortals. As she devoured more souls, she began to feel the emotions of her victims and became more empathetic and reluctant to continue her hunts. After the death of her lover, Ahri became consumed with regret and guilt, completely ashamed of her Vesani nature and distancing herself completely from society, only ever interacting with people to feast on their essence and sate her hunger. Ahri's pain grew so large that she simply wanted to forget all the painful memories, but ultimately decided that these memories were too valuable to let go of learned to carry her memories with her, no matter how painful they are.\nThough deceivingly old and wise with the knowledge of the many memories she had consumed over the years, Ahri carries a youthful demeanor with a witty, mischievous and even flirty attitude. Although she remains somewhat moody and impulsive, sometimes losing control of her ravenous hunger, she has become incredibly empathetic with her abilities to consume emotions, even empathizing with those that would wish her harm. After choosing to cleanse the memories of her ancestors from her sunstones, Ahri found closure with her past and now lives to uphold the wisdoms of the Vesani by looking towards the future and allowing herself to make new memories instead of dwelling on her old ones.\nSince childhood, Ahri has observed human civilization from afar until she encountered a hunter dying from a stray arrow. Curiously sensing his fading life force, Ahri got her first taste of spiritual essence and absorbed the man's memories, gaining all his knowledge and experiences. Since then, Ahri hunted down human prey for years, drunkenly drinking their essence and learning to manipulate them with her charms.\nShe slowly felt a sense of regret as she grew empathetic from absorbing human emotions, eventually seeing how they perceived her as a monstrous fox demon. Despite this, Ahri accepted her monstrous nature and continued to feast on human essence. It wasn't until she met her first and only love, a human artist, that she began to feel true sympathy for humans and decided to completely Now, after befriending Yasuo and the rest of Sarah Fortune's crew, she feels a deep sense of empathy and sympathy or her prey, sparing them from her hunger by learning to control it.\nYears ago, Ahri fell in love with a human artist who remains as her first and only true love. Unlike the rest of Ahri's prey, the artist was the first person to willingly offer his essence to Ahri in exchange for her love, to which she agreed. From there, she felt true happiness for the first time as the two would often lay in a lake at the edge of Ionia. Unfortunately, Ahri lost control of her hunger one day and accidentally drained her lover completely, thoroughly killing him.\nFor years Ahri lived in constant regret over the death of her lover and attempted to remove the memories of him entirely at the Garden of Forgetting . In the process though, Ahri realized that her memories of her lover were too valuable to simply let go of and decided to live with them, no matter how painful it is to remember.\nAhri finally found closure with the death of her lover when she cleansed the memories of her ancestors from the sunstones at the Buhru forge. In the process of this, Ahri sorrowed over the loss of the memories of her ancestors but was confronted with a memory of her lover, who urged Ahri to fight for the future and told her to live life to create new memories instead of dwelling on her old ones. This interaction defined Ahri, allowing her to live as she does now, as a protector of life in the same vein as her Vesani ancestors.\nHirin was a fortune teller that Ahri encountered in an Ionian market during her search for clues about her long-lost vastayan tribe. The fortune teller recognized Ahri's mysterious set of twin sunstones as the work of Ymelo, which intrigued Ahri as she agreed to enter her caravan for tea and to discuss more about her stones. Hirin revealed everything she knew about Ymelo to Ahri, before pulling out a hunting knife and revealing that she had put a paralysis potion in Ahri's cup of tea. Wishing to cut off one of her tails as an ingredient for her potions, Ahri managed to absorb enough of Hirin's essence to regain her strength and defend herself. Though she was furious at the betrayal, she looked into Hirin's memories and hardships in life, deciding to spare her life and leaving her without any memory of their encounter, essentially making her forget Ahri completely.\nThe Gardener is the mysterious caretaker of the Garden of Forgetting , also known as Ighilya by Ahri. The Gardener seems to be a person with some magical affinity rumored to be a witch of some sorts and offered Ahri guidance when she arrived to the garden with regret and sorrows over her dead lover. Though Ahri desperately begged the Gardener to help her forget these painful memories, she was reluctant to help her and urged her to live life with the pain and attempting to convince her that forgetting is much worse than living with the pain. As Ahri was in the process of feeding her memories to a snow lily given to her by the Gardener, she finally took her advice and refused to forget, believing that her memories of her lover were too valuable to forget. When the garden attempted to trap Ahri for interrupting the process, the Gardener quietly warned Ahri to leave before it was too late, allowing her to escape.\nYmelo is the famed sculptor said to have created Ahri's twin sunstones as well as many others. Though who his true origins are unknown, he's famed across the world for his ability to carve ancient fossilized eggs into intricate shapes and often creates small artifacts as pieces of larger sculptors. After learning of Ymelo, Ahri found clues leading her to Bilgewater, where she confronted a vendor at a black market and tried finding another of his sculptors, which the vendor sold to Malik of the Jagged Hooks .\nThe Vesani are Ahri's long-lost vastayan tribe. Since her childhood, Ahri was completely unaware of their existence and lived lost and questioning her origins. After embracing her nature as a vastaya, Ahri dedicated herself in finding clues about her Vesani ancestors, hoping that she could learn how to control her insatiable hunger for spiritual essence.\nHer quest eventually lead her to the Shadow Isles , where she discovered the deep history the Vesani have with the now cursed Blessed Isles. By delving into their many vaults across the isles, studying their artifacts and sensing the memories left over by her people, Ahri learned that the Vesani were a nomadic tribe that traveled to the Blessed Isles and allied themselves with the Helians , becoming experts on magic related to memories.\nWhen Ahri was forced to decide between containing the collected knowledge of her ancestors or the discarded memories of the Ruined King , she decided the latter and saw the memories of her people fade away. Mourning this, she was confronted by a memory of her long dead lover, who urged Ahri to fight for the future instead of dwelling on the past. With this, Ahri dedicates herself to upholding the teachings of the Vesani, becoming a protector of life and memories, looking to the future and creating new memories to honor her ancestors.\nThe crew of the Charming Lady is a group that come together in order to stop Viego and confront the Black Mist. Throughout their journey, Ahri forms a bond based on their shared experiences. This crew consisted of Braum , Illaoi , Pyke , Yasuo , Ahri and was led by Sarah Fortune\nSarah Fortune is the captain of the Charming Lady and acts as the leader of the crew. Though she was initially distrustful of Ahri due to the fact that she fed on some of her crewmates' essences, she learned to trust and respect Ahri's powers after the crew found her in the Shadow Isles . Sarah is somewhat intimidated by Ahri's abilities, most notably her ability to absorb life essence and manipulate peoples' emotions, but she also respects them, often stating how she's jealous of Ahri's abilities to read people so easily and that she considers herself lucky to have Ahri on their side. The two eventually share even more respect for one another, as Ahri realizes the struggle Sarah faces when trying to maintain control of Bilgewater and Sarah respects Ahri's capability of restraining her hunger for spiritual essence.\nThe two were instrumental in defeating Viego together, as Ahri used the memories contained within her sunstone while Sarah proceeded to use the Buhru amulet on the weakened Ruined King.\nBraum was a member of the crew of the Charming Lady, having been the one who named the vessel in the first place. When the two first meet, Ahri admits that she initially assumed Braum was a troll when they first met due to his massive stature, which makes Braum laugh. The two become quick friends, as Ahri is one of the few on the crew that finds his boundless optimism and 'spirited' nature entertaining. Braum eventually confides in Ahri about Yasuo's unwavering dedication to protect her, which flatters Ahri and kickstarts her rising relationship with Yasuo as well. The two curiously exchange information about each other's homelands, such as Braum explaining the Iceborn to Ahri and even going so far as to invite her personally to visit the Freljord one day.\nIllaoi was a member of the crew of the Charming Lady and a close ally of Sarah Fortune. When they first find Ahri at the Shadow Isles, Illaoi is the one who suggest they join Ahri on entering the Vesani vaults. Unlike others, Illaoi doesn't share a sense of distrust or even fears Ahri's hunger at all, instead being mostly intrigued of her ability to sense the spirits and memories of the Vesani. Illaoi states to Ahri that she has proven she is worthy of their trust and that is why she has no reason to fear her, which Ahri is both cautioned yet flattered by. As the two empathize on their quests to seek their own truths and places in the universe, Illaoi preaches that she believes that their fates are intertwined and that, as a member of the crew, Ahri can seek the answers she is looking for.\nPyke was a member of the crew of the Charming Lady and joined the rest of the crew on their mission to stop the Ruined King. When they met, Ahri instantly knew that Pyke wasn't entirely human as he bluntly explained his vengeful origins. The two share similarities of having murderous pasts, but Ahri painfully reflects on hers while Pyke simply accepts his nature as a murderer and states Ahri should do the same. The two are also the only seemingly immortal members of the Charming Lady crew, as Pyke tells Ahri that he doesn't care about the future and only wants to find the revenge he's been searching for. Ahri, using her abilities, sees more on Pyke's mind beyond his desire to kill.\nAhri met Yasuo during a Spirit Blossom festival, hiring him to be her bodyguard on her way to Bilgewater . Though she initially kept her distance from him, not even revealing her name let alone her nature as a vastaya, he managed to find out the truth and, though Ahri was reluctant to keep him around, Yasuo still promised to stay by her side and disregarded Ahri's warnings of her ravenous nature. After of her dead lover, Ahri realized that bringing Yasuo was a mistake and instead ran away to continue her quest without him, seeing it as a mercy and a way of keeping Yasuo safe from herself. Despite this, Yasuo refused to fail as a body guard a second time and dedicated himself to finding Ahri, going as far as to join the crew of the Charming Lady on their way to the Shadow Isles .\nAfter they reunite when Ahri joins the crew at the Shadow Isles, the two grew closer as Ahri, regretful for leaving Yasuo, decided to explain herself and revealed why she ran away in the first place. Overtime, the two bond over their shared Ionian heritage and their renewed sense of purpose by travelling outside of their shared homeland. After being shipwrecked on a mysterious island with mystical winds, Ahri witnesses Yasuo confront the shadows of his past and empathies with his trauma, having a similar tragedy happen to her as well. Together, they vow to move past their own grief in favor of a better future.\nYasuo cares deeply for Ahri not only as her protector but also in a more personal way. Ahri on the other hand states that Yasuo reminds her of her dead lover in a few ways, most notably in the way he makes her laugh with his brooding yet witty sense of humor.\nViego sought to resurrect his dead queen Isolde at any cost, risking to plunge the entire world in an endless Harrowing . As a member of the Charming Lady, Ahri joined the rest of the crew in defeating him and preventing his catastrophic plan. Thanks to her unique ability to control memories, Ahri was the one who found Viego's discarded memories of his twisted love, willing to sacrifice the memories of her ancestors within her sunstone in order to contain and weaponize the discarded memories against the Ruined King.\nIn the final battle, Ahri was instrumental in Viego's defeat, clouding his mind with the discarded memories and forcing him to relive them. This weakened him enough to allow the rest of the crew to defeat him as Sarah Fortune imprisoned him within an amulet.\nThresh allied himself with Gangplank as part of his plan to awaken Viego in the Shadow Isles. As part of his plan, Thresh had Gangplank collect a multitude of relics, including a sunstone that Ahri had been chasing after. While exploring his fortress, Ahri finds many Vesani artifacts and knowledge hidden away in Thresh's collection, giving her more clues to her ancestors. Ahri aided the crew in defeating Thresh, forcing him to return to the Black Mist before going after Gangplank next.\nMalik is a member of the Jagged Hooks and a lieutenant of Gangplank . When Ahri was searching for one of Ymelo's sunstones at a black market, she learned that Malik already purchased it and traveled to the Shadow Isles, causing Ahri to follow him. At the Shadow Isles, Malik saw Ahri passed through the isles, as he gave the sunstone to his captain before dying after he released a Shadow Isles mistwraith and was attacked.\nAs part of Thresh's plan to awaken Viego, he sent Gangplank to collect a multitude of artifacts to aid him, including one of the Vesani sunstones. By following various clues and travelling to the Shadow Isles herself, she learns that Gangplank got a hold of the sunstone she was searching for and scoured the isles for him, eventually finding the stone in Thresh's library. Ahri helped the rest of the crew defeat Gangplank when he got possessed by the Ruined King.\nAhri first encounters and befriends Maokai when she travels to the Shadow Isles in search of Gangplank and his sunstone. While in his grove, Ahri is told the origins of the Shadow Isles by Maokai, learning about the gentle caretaker underneath his frightening exterior. Ahri aids the rest of the crew when they try to cleanse his roots to allow him to restore his grove, followed by them blessing one of his seeds to empower him even further."}

Though she holds onto all she learned from her master Shen, she has pledged to defend Ionia from its enemies, one kill at a time. Akali may strike in silence, but her message will be heard loud and clear: fear the assassin with no master.\nAkali was born within the Kinkou Order , daughter to Tahno and Maymm Jhomen Tethi. Maymm was the renowned Fist of Shadow and one of the Kinkou leaders in charge of preserving the delicate spiritual balance of Ionia . As a child, Akali's parents would often be called off on their duties, leaving her under the care of other Kinkou masters such as Master Kusho or Kennen . When in the care of Kennen, Akali would be taught many shuriken techniques and honed her skills in speed and agility. Being a prodigy, Akali showed great promise as a member of the Kinkou Order and woult often train alongside Master Kusho's son and appointed successor Shen .\nDuring the Noxian Invasion of Ionia , Master Kusho's adopted son and former student Zed returned to the order after having left to participate in the war. With an army of his own followers, Zed planned to enact a violent takeover of the Kinkou Order and seemingly killed Master Kusho, transforming the Kinkou into the Shadow Order . Zed and his acolytes proceeded to kill the remaining Kinkou, including Akali's father Tahno. Luckily, Akali fled to a long-abandoned temple in the eastern mountains alongside a small group of other Kinkou consisting of her mother Maymm, Kennen and the new Eye of Twilight , Shen.\nIn the mountains, Shen began rebuilding the Kinkou Order by returning to its three fundamental philosophes: the pure impartiality of Watching the Stars , the passage of judgment in Coursing the Sun , and the elimination of imbalance by Pruning the Tree. As Fist of Shadow, Maymm's duty was in Pruning the Tree, training Akali and several other neophytes to become assassins that would kill those that would threaten the balance. By the age of nine, Akali became close friends with another neophyte name Faey, Maymm's young apprentice and possible successor. Though Akali was skilled, she was often impatient and rambunctious, often causing trouble for Faey and the neophytes due to being the youngest of them.\nAkali's friend and fellow neophyte Faey, firing arrows and attempting to free her friends.\nWhile training and playing games, Akali and the rest of the neophytes encountered a band of warriors from the Navori Brotherhood , an Ionian  nationalist faction formed in the aftermath of the Noxian invasion currently searching for people to forcefully recruit into their army. Akali and the group of neophytes hid in the trees, not wanting to lead the brotherhood back to their Kinkou temple. Using a variety of tricks and traps, they managed to scare the warriors away by convincing them that the forest was cursed.\nIn the process, the group accidentally angered a corrupted nature spirit that began rampaging and entrapping the neophytes in vines. Faey quickly tried freeing them while Akali helped, against Faey's orders, by hastily running circles around the spirit, distracting it. While Akali dragged some of the neophytes to safety, Faey was suddenly struck by the spirit and fell to the ground, becoming gravely injured and breaking her leg. At that moment, Maymm, Shen and Kennen arrived just in time to dispel the spirit and save the children.\nBack at the temple, Akali was praised by her fellow students for her speed in saving them. When Faey woke up, she realized the severity of her injuries as she was missing a leg and unable to walk. When Akali tried to comfort her, Faey snapped at Akali, blaming her and angered by the fact that she disobeyed her orders. Hearing her distrss, Maymm enetered the room and comforted Faey, vowing to find a way to heal Faey's leg and allow her to walk again so she can fight alongside her as her apprentice once again. Akali, overhearing the conversation, saw the kindness Maymm harbored for Faey and tearfully walked off. [ 1 ]\nAt the age of fourteen, Akali formally entered her Kinkou training, determined to eventually succeed her mother in becoming the new Fist of Shadow. Though she possessed no magical talents like the other acolytes who would fill her role, she proved her worth of the title by sheer skill. Soon, Maymm stepped down from her role as Fist of Shadow and focused on mentoring the other neophytes, officially granting Akali the title as her successor.\nAs the Noxian Invasion ended and the Shadow Order reached an uneasy accord with the Kinkou, Akali slowly saw the suffering her people still endured. She began to question her purpose as the Fist of Shadow and whether or not she was truly fulfilling her duties in Pruning the Tree . Shen would constantly urge restraint, teaching her meditation techniques and mantras to tame her spirit. However, Akali believed Shen was holding her back, constantly arguing and defying him as she took down Ionia's enemies in her own way.\nFinally growing sick of Shen's views on Ionia's balance, Akali insulted the entire order by declaring their impotence, claiming their lack of action in favor of spiritual balance has lead to more Ionians suffering in the Material Realm. Akali officially left order, discarding her title as Fist of Shadow, while Shen let her go without arguing. Shen believed that this was a path that Akali must walk alone with hopes of her returning to the order one day, though he knows that is a decision only she can make herself.\nNow living as an independent assassin, free from the restraints of the Kinkou Order's teachings, Akali lived as a vigilante, traversing the urban underground of Ionia and killing those that cause her people harm.\nIn the coastal village of Weh'le , a hidden phantom port with mystical properties, Akali went on a mission to assassinate a councilman from Puboe who had sold out his own people to Noxian invaders in exchange for gold and safe passage through. She visited her tattoo artist Bo'lii, a vastayan artist who ran a tavern in the port. While drawing a tattoo of a dragon on her back, the Puboe councilman walked into Bo'lii's tavern accompanied by three guards. Akali planned to kill them on the spot, but Bo'lii urged her to do her business outside of his tavern this time, to which she agreed. Once outside, Akali approached and killed the councilman's guards by hiding in a smoke cloud and firing several kunais before finally killing the councilman himself. [ 2 ]\nDespite being an independent assassin and having left the Kinkou Order, Akali still retained a close relationship with Shen, who continued acting as her mentor. One day, the two came across a Noxian boy in the Navori province cutting wood from a Guardian Tree . While Akali plans to punish the Noxian with brute force, Shen suggests she finds a different approach. As the Noxian loaded up his cart, Akali arrived and broke the wagon's wheels with her shuriken, discovering that the Noxian is actually a young boy to Akali's surprise.\nAs the sap of the Guardian Tree began to flow into a shrine, it awoke its protector; a large stone guardian that slowly walked towards the Noxian boy. By granting Akali his ability to see into the Spirit Realm , he revealed to Akali that the protector was powered by the anger of the forest, seeking to restore balance and avenge the Guardian Tree by killing the Noxian boy. Against Shen's wishes, Akali rushed forward and attacked the protector with little to no effect. While trying to lift the wagon off of the Noxian boy, Akali realized that the only way to restore the balance is if the boy planted a new tree in its place. By taking a seed from a nearby branch, Akali had the boy plant the seed into the ground before Shen used his spiritual powers to instantly grow the seed into a sapling, taming the stone protector. Lifting the wagon off of the boy, Akali gave him a warning not to harm the land as Shen used his powers to grow the sapling into an even larger Guardian Tree, wrapping itself around the shrine guardian. [ 3 ]\nIn Zhyun , Akali got word that Zed recently assassinated the Kinkou master Althon, a cousin of Shen. Finding Shen in the Olgathee Forest killing corrupted spirits, Akali told him the news about master Althon, stating that she knows the town that Zed is staying in and suggesting she and Shen go confront him, which he reluctantly agrees to. [ 4 ]\nOnce at a tavern in Thonx , the two found out from the innkeeper that Zed had already left and attacked a blossom festival before heading north to Shual . Akali suggested they follow him, but Shen stated that he had to travel south to slay demons that have been terrorizing a village. Akali tried to convince Shen to follow her to Shual, but Shen remained dedicated to his duties as the Eye of Twilight, urging his former student not to chase Zed alone. Akali, disregarding Shen's warning, took a boat and sailed down the quickest route to Shual. [ 5 ]\nAkali at a Kinkou temple confronting members of the Shadow Order , including Shieda Kayn .\nTravelling to an inn near the Kinkou temple of Koeshin, Akali found a group of Zed's acolytes disguised as Kinkou, including Zed's apprentice Shieda Kayn . Kayn told Akali that their masters were inside the inn while Akali threatened them by calling a group of Kinkou warriors to defend the temple. Zed then exited the inn followed by Shen, who ordered Akali to let the Shadow Order walk free since Zed declared the Code of Tuonn, an honorable call for temporary peace that allows them to let each other walk free without combat. Akali however wasn't satisfied with just letting Zed go and dashed in to kill him anyway, which Zed easily avoided by shadow shifting away while the rest of his acolytes quickly fled the Kinkou temple. Angered by Akali's recklessness, Shen told her never to fight Zed and that he'll fight him alone in the future, officially declaring that the armistice between the Shadow Order and the Kinkou has ended.\nShen eventually revealed to Akali what transpired in the inn; Zed came to warn Shen that the serial killer Khada Jhin had escaped and that he seeks to bring him back to prison. Though Zed wanted to ally with Shen and capture Jhin, Shen refused and insisted on catching Jhin on his own without the help of the Shadow Order, declaring that if he sees Zed interfere then he'll personally kill him and finally settle their scores.\nAkali followed Shen as he investigated a trail of intricate clues in search of the murderer Khada Jhin. Shen's investigation eventually lead him to believe that Jhin was working with the Kashuri faction , a radical nationalist group with ties to the Navori Brotherhood. This trail lead Shen to Nanthee , believing that the village elder was a potential target of Jhin's murder spree. Once at the scene of the crime, Shen stopped Akali from looking at the corpses, stating that she simply isn't ready to see the horrors that Jhin committed. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]\nEventually, Jhin's traps activated as dozens of bombs hidden in lanterns across Nanthee began exploding, killing many and causing massive damage to the city. Akali, noticing the explosion from afar, vows to kill Jhin for what he'd done. Noticing a small ship in the distance and deducing that that's where Jhin was escaping, Akali demanded to know where it was headed, learning that it was headed to the Piltover .\nDeciding to follow Jhin's trail alone, Akali set sail and eventually landed in Piltover. On her search for Jhin, Akali questioned and interrogated many of the locals, which lead her to the undercity of Zaun . In Zaun, she learned that Jhin had been attacking Piltover merchant clans that did business in exporting weapons to Ionia. By questioning the Piltover enforcers, Akali found herself at a theater in the Zaunite neighborhood of Mistfloor, where Jhin was said to have battled with the Ferros clan and their intelligencer agent . [ 8 ]\nAt the theater, Jhin revealed an elaborate trap for Akali, wishing to make her the fourth victim in his disturbing art piece as three piltovans hung from Ionian trees strapped to machines. These machines began firing harpoons at Akali, who narrowly dodged them by tossing a smoke bomb before being hit unconscious by an explosive blast created by Jhin's rifle . [ 9 ]\nJhin, having anticipated Zed and Shen's arrivals, set a trap by tying Akali up in a tree near a decoy of his. While Jhin tried to kill the two of them with Zaunite machinery, Zed managed to toss a shuriken at Akali, cutting her rope and freeing her from Jhin's trap. While Jhin was ready to fire a shot into Shen's head, Akali burst out of the smoke and punched Jhin to the ground, grabbing his gun and preparing to kill him for his crimes while Shen pleaded for her not to as he needed to bring Jhin to Ionia alive. Before she could kill him, Zed pushed her aside and grabbed Jhin, demanding he tell him how he got out of prison. Jhin simply replied with cryptic riddles, stating that Zed already knew who freed him before Zed threw Jhin to Shen and Akali's feet, stating that their bargain is done as he quickly fled Zaun. [ 10 ]\nAkali joining the effort to defend Ionia from Noxus alongside Irelia , Kennen , Karma and Yasuo .\nAt some point, Noxus began a second incursion of Ionia, sending massive armies accompanied by the undead juggernaut Sion . When the Ionian war hero Irelia began a resistance, she requested aid at a seaside village and received assistance from Kinkou members lead by Akali and Kennen , the spiritual leader Karma and the lone wanderer Yasuo . During the defense against the Noxian army, Akali targeted Sion and struck him with her kama and smoke bombs before joining Irelia and the rest of the champions in a final charge against the Noxians. [ 8 ]\nAkali is a slender but muscular woman with light skin and red-brown eyes. Her thick black hair is often tussled, tied back in a large, messy bun which flares in every direction. She also has a tattoo of a pale blue dragon among white clouds swirling around her arms and across the backs of her shoulders.\nHer typical professional attire is various shades of green with brown leather highlights. She wears baggy pants, a crop top, tabi, and a cloth mask that covers her lower face.\nAkali is impatient, explosive and determined, preferring to leave the Kinkou Order rather than betray her own ideals and not fight for her people. It is notable that, despite this, she is still loyal to Ionia, being able to do anything, even to become a murderer, to protect the First Lands and her home.\nAkali is currently a ninja gone rogue from the Kinkou Order . Although still part of it, she operates outside of its rules and regulations. [ 11 ] She and Shen parted on neutral terms. Neither hates the other but both disapprove of the other's methods. [ 12 ] While growing up in the Kinkou, Kennen trained her and helped her refine her shuriken techniques.\nZed might attempt to recruit her for his Order of Shadows. Akali; however, wants him dead since many Kinkou members including her father Tahno were killed by him and his order.\nAkali and Kayn know each other. He has tried to flirt with her multiple times and Akali finds him hot but too crazy for her taste.\nAkali temporarily teamed up with Shen to track down Jhin after they were informed of his escape. She later pursued Jhin to Piltover - Zaun and got captured by him, but was later saved with the help of Shen and Zed .\nIn the second Noxian invasion of Ionia , Irelia's call for help to defend a seaside village from the Noxian army including Sion was met by Akali, Karma , Kennen and Yasuo whose arrival turned the tide of the battle."}

Though she holds onto all she learned from her master Shen, she has pledged to defend Ionia from its enemies, one kill at a time. Akali may strike in silence, but her message will be heard loud and clear: fear the assassin with no master.\nAkali was born within the Kinkou Order , daughter to Tahno and Maymm Jhomen Tethi. Maymm was the renowned Fist of Shadow and one of the Kinkou leaders in charge of preserving the delicate spiritual balance of Ionia . As a child, Akali's parents would often be called off on their duties, leaving her under the care of other Kinkou masters such as Master Kusho or Kennen . When in the care of Kennen, Akali would be taught many shuriken techniques and honed her skills in speed and agility. Being a prodigy, Akali showed great promise as a member of the Kinkou Order and woult often train alongside Master Kusho's son and appointed successor Shen .\nDuring the Noxian Invasion of Ionia , Master Kusho's adopted son and former student Zed returned to the order after having left to participate in the war. With an army of his own followers, Zed planned to enact a violent takeover of the Kinkou Order and seemingly killed Master Kusho, transforming the Kinkou into the Shadow Order . Zed and his acolytes proceeded to kill the remaining Kinkou, including Akali's father Tahno. Luckily, Akali fled to a long-abandoned temple in the eastern mountains alongside a small group of other Kinkou consisting of her mother Maymm, Kennen and the new Eye of Twilight , Shen.\nIn the mountains, Shen began rebuilding the Kinkou Order by returning to its three fundamental philosophes: the pure impartiality of Watching the Stars , the passage of judgment in Coursing the Sun , and the elimination of imbalance by Pruning the Tree. As Fist of Shadow, Maymm's duty was in Pruning the Tree, training Akali and several other neophytes to become assassins that would kill those that would threaten the balance. By the age of nine, Akali became close friends with another neophyte name Faey, Maymm's young apprentice and possible successor. Though Akali was skilled, she was often impatient and rambunctious, often causing trouble for Faey and the neophytes due to being the youngest of them.\nAkali's friend and fellow neophyte Faey, firing arrows and attempting to free her friends.\nWhile training and playing games, Akali and the rest of the neophytes encountered a band of warriors from the Navori Brotherhood , an Ionian  nationalist faction formed in the aftermath of the Noxian invasion currently searching for people to forcefully recruit into their army. Akali and the group of neophytes hid in the trees, not wanting to lead the brotherhood back to their Kinkou temple. Using a variety of tricks and traps, they managed to scare the warriors away by convincing them that the forest was cursed.\nIn the process, the group accidentally angered a corrupted nature spirit that began rampaging and entrapping the neophytes in vines. Faey quickly tried freeing them while Akali helped, against Faey's orders, by hastily running circles around the spirit, distracting it. While Akali dragged some of the neophytes to safety, Faey was suddenly struck by the spirit and fell to the ground, becoming gravely injured and breaking her leg. At that moment, Maymm, Shen and Kennen arrived just in time to dispel the spirit and save the children.\nBack at the temple, Akali was praised by her fellow students for her speed in saving them. When Faey woke up, she realized the severity of her injuries as she was missing a leg and unable to walk. When Akali tried to comfort her, Faey snapped at Akali, blaming her and angered by the fact that she disobeyed her orders. Hearing her distrss, Maymm enetered the room and comforted Faey, vowing to find a way to heal Faey's leg and allow her to walk again so she can fight alongside her as her apprentice once again. Akali, overhearing the conversation, saw the kindness Maymm harbored for Faey and tearfully walked off. [ 1 ]\nAt the age of fourteen, Akali formally entered her Kinkou training, determined to eventually succeed her mother in becoming the new Fist of Shadow. Though she possessed no magical talents like the other acolytes who would fill her role, she proved her worth of the title by sheer skill. Soon, Maymm stepped down from her role as Fist of Shadow and focused on mentoring the other neophytes, officially granting Akali the title as her successor.\nAs the Noxian Invasion ended and the Shadow Order reached an uneasy accord with the Kinkou, Akali slowly saw the suffering her people still endured. She began to question her purpose as the Fist of Shadow and whether or not she was truly fulfilling her duties in Pruning the Tree . Shen would constantly urge restraint, teaching her meditation techniques and mantras to tame her spirit. However, Akali believed Shen was holding her back, constantly arguing and defying him as she took down Ionia's enemies in her own way.\nFinally growing sick of Shen's views on Ionia's balance, Akali insulted the entire order by declaring their impotence, claiming their lack of action in favor of spiritual balance has lead to more Ionians suffering in the Material Realm. Akali officially left order, discarding her title as Fist of Shadow, while Shen let her go without arguing. Shen believed that this was a path that Akali must walk alone with hopes of her returning to the order one day, though he knows that is a decision only she can make herself.\nNow living as an independent assassin, free from the restraints of the Kinkou Order's teachings, Akali lived as a vigilante, traversing the urban underground of Ionia and killing those that cause her people harm.\nIn the coastal village of Weh'le , a hidden phantom port with mystical properties, Akali went on a mission to assassinate a councilman from Puboe who had sold out his own people to Noxian invaders in exchange for gold and safe passage through. She visited her tattoo artist Bo'lii, a vastayan artist who ran a tavern in the port. While drawing a tattoo of a dragon on her back, the Puboe councilman walked into Bo'lii's tavern accompanied by three guards. Akali planned to kill them on the spot, but Bo'lii urged her to do her business outside of his tavern this time, to which she agreed. Once outside, Akali approached and killed the councilman's guards by hiding in a smoke cloud and firing several kunais before finally killing the councilman himself. [ 2 ]\nDespite being an independent assassin and having left the Kinkou Order, Akali still retained a close relationship with Shen, who continued acting as her mentor. One day, the two came across a Noxian boy in the Navori province cutting wood from a Guardian Tree . While Akali plans to punish the Noxian with brute force, Shen suggests she finds a different approach. As the Noxian loaded up his cart, Akali arrived and broke the wagon's wheels with her shuriken, discovering that the Noxian is actually a young boy to Akali's surprise.\nAs the sap of the Guardian Tree began to flow into a shrine, it awoke its protector; a large stone guardian that slowly walked towards the Noxian boy.

While trying to lift the wagon off of the Noxian boy, Akali realized that the only way to restore the balance is if the boy planted a new tree in its place. By taking a seed from a nearby branch, Akali had the boy plant the seed into the ground before Shen used his spiritual powers to instantly grow the seed into a sapling, taming the stone protector. Lifting the wagon off of the boy, Akali gave him a warning not to harm the land as Shen used his powers to grow the sapling into an even larger Guardian Tree, wrapping itself around the shrine guardian. [ 3 ]\nIn Zhyun , Akali got word that Zed recently assassinated the Kinkou master Althon, a cousin of Shen.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ]\nEventually, Jhin's traps activated as dozens of bombs hidden in lanterns across Nanthee began exploding, killing many and causing massive damage to the city.

He is highly skilled in the art of stealth combat , able to evade the eyes of his enemies and reappear when they least expect him. With a keen sense of justice and a legendary death-reversing weapon , he rights the wrongs of Runeterra's many scoundrels while living by his own moral code: \"Don't be an ass.\"\nAkshan grew up an orphan in the Shuriman city of Marwi, where brutal warlords ruled by subjugating the civilians and taking what they wanted. As a young boy, Akshan refused to let these misdeeds go unnoticed and often intervened at the sight of injustice. This eventually lead to Akshan making enemies with powerful warlords who eventually beat him to near-death, leaving him unconscious and dying on the street.\nAkshan was soon found by an elderly woman named Shadya, who took him into her home and miraculously nursed him back to health. While staying with the old woman, Akshan discovered Shadya was a member of the Sentinels of Light ; an ancient order dedicated to protecting the world from horrors of Undead . Despite his shortcomings as a stubborn and troubled youth, Shadya saw immense potential in Akshan due to his dedication to fighting injustice. Shadya offered to allow Akshan to safely live with her and in exchange he'd dedicate himself to the Sentinels of Light order, which Akshan happily agreed to.\nShadya and Akshan formed a fast bond, as Shadya mentored Akshan everything she knew to survive as a solo Sentinel. As Akshan's Sentinel skills grew under Shadya's tutelage, he slowly noticed his mentor growing more distant. When the time came, Shadya finally revealed to her pupil the source of her concern, that a Harrowing was coming, larger than the world had ever seen with an army of undead from the Shadow Isles . Shadya stated that their only hope in defending against this future threat is laid in a collection of ancient Sentinel weapons buried in Shurima's crypts and tombs. However, they would find most of their weapons gone, pilfered by local warlords who sought to unlock their powers for themselves. The Sentinels would try to negotiate the return of their weapons, but to no avail. With time running out, they would have to make do with what they had left.\nAs they took stock of their remaining arsenal, one peculiar relic gun would catch Akshan's eye, but it was quickly snatched away by Shadya, who forbade him from ever using it. This weapon was known as the Absolver, a gun that was enchanted to revive anyone who was recently killed by someone, if it kills its target. Shadya believed that only fate should wield the powers of life and death, but Akshan disagreed, believing that fate needed a little help. Akshan continued to pry for more information about the weapon until Shadya revealed the truth, she had used it to revive the young sentinel. Shadya once wielded the Absolver and slayed Akshan's would-be murderer many years ago, restoring him to life. The revelation would cause Akshan ponder what had made him so worthy of being revived. While Akshan questioned the antiquated rules of his order, Shadya continued to press the warlords to return their weapons, leading to tensions between the two groups.\nThings would come to a head on one tragic day, when Akshan would find Shadya murdered on the streets. After burying her within the sentinel base of Shurima, Akshan would disregard his late-mentor's wishes and armed himself with the Absolver, after making a few modifications. Filled with vengeance, Akshan decides to abandon the sentinel's cause and prepares for a new mission: to avenge his fallen teacher. He now hunts for his mentor's killer, delivering comeuppance to one warlord at a time.\nThe great Harrowing would soon arrive, blanketing the world in Black Mist. Lucian and a Sentinel Rookie would come to the Shuriman Sentinel base in search of the Absolver. The two would encounter Akshan, who explained what had happened to Shadya and his mission to bring her back. Akshan then departed to hunt down another warlord. The two Sentinels followed Akshan to the warlord's compound and watched the Absolver in action. After dispatching the warlord, the trio raced back to the base to see if Shadya was resurrected. When they find her body still lifeless, Lucian tries to recruiting him, but Akshan remains undeterred, and leaves to face another warlord.\nAs the two Sentinels prepare to return to headquarters, they notice that Viego is in the town below, searching for another fetter. As they confront the Ruined King, he unleashes an army of ghouls against them, making short work of the sentinels. As they lay dying, Akshan returns, having had a change of heart, and quickly dispatches the ghouls and takes their bodies back to the base. The two reawaken, realizing they were revived by the Absolver. Finally understanding Shadya's life goal was the sentinel's cause, Akshan finally agrees to join them and returns to Sentinel headquarters. Senna scolds Lucian and the Rookie for leaving in the middle of night for a secret a mission and at Akshan for his dress code violations.\nAkshan joins the rest the Sentinels and Gwen as they mount their final assault against Viego on the Shadow Isles. As Senna draws out Viego, the Sentinels ambush him. Viego quickly turns the tide of the battle and quickly dispatches Senna and Gwen and creates a portal to Camavor and takes the fetters through. Akshan manages to slip through the portal as well and tries to take Viego out with the Absolver, but soon realizes his weapon is ineffective against the Ruined King. However, he is prompted by the recently revived Queen Isolde to shoot her instead, and he fires at the queen, returning her to eternal rest once again. With Isolde gone, Viego begins to weaken and Senna and Gwen are brought back to life. With their combined efforts, they manage to defeat the Ruined King and imprison him with Hallowed Mist.\nThey return to the Shadow Isles and reunite with their allies until they sense another dark presence approaching. Thresh arrives and reveals that he is now unbound from the Shadow Isles. He demands one of their souls in exchange for Senna's escaping, or all of their souls if none comply. The Sentinels try to resist him, but he proves too powerful. The Rookie offers their soul to Thresh instead, but as he prepares to harvest soul, the Rookie unleashes their wayfinder and teleports everyone back to headquarters instead. With Viego defeated, Akshan decides to return to Shurima and continue to honor Shadya's legacy.\nAfter returning to Shurima, Akshan begins to forget his mentor and tries to find mementos to keep her memory alive. One day he recognizes a peculiar bracelet on the arm of a street urchin, realizing it once belonged to Shadya, he interrogates the child. The young girl reveals that she stole it from one of the warlords, determined to reclaim his master's lost jewelry, Akshan prepares to confront the warlord. Later that night, Akshan sneaks into the warlord's palace and holds him at gunpoint, demanding a confession. The sentinel orders the warlord to admit that he killed Shadya, after finding the rest of her jewelry in his possession, but he refutes the claim and asks what he really wants instead. Taking a second to ponder the question, Akshan realizes he wants peace and executes the warlord.\nAs Akshan walks back to city, his memories of Shadya continue to fade. He knows that she would not have approved of him killing the warlord out of vengeance, but he had done it for himself, yet it did not grant him the peace he desired. Looking towards the bracelets for solace, he notices an inscription on one of them, an old sentinel mantra: \"Give all, and all may live.\" The sentinel suddenly has an epiphany and fires his grappling hook, he swings from building to building until he finds his target, the urchin from yesterday. He finds the young girl sleeping in an alley and wakes her, he then offers her Shadya's remaining bracelets, knowing it is what she would have wanted. Despite parting with the last remnants of his mentor, he now has the peace he was looking for, knowing Shadya would approve.\nAkshan is an attractive young man with olive-colored skin, brown eyes, a short beard, and long, dark chocolate brown hair. He mainly wears a cloak with the emblem of the Sentinels of Light, wears no shirt and exposes his bare chest, wears black pants, black boots with gold stripes, and has several Shuriman amulets on his arms and hands.\nAkshan is a charming young man who carries himself with confident swagger, boasting about his own abilities and quipping about his enemies. Underneath his usual charismatic demeanor, Akshan wishes to get revenge on those who wrong others, to the point where he prioritizes his own thirst for vengeance over his allies' wishes. Although he is unsure of whom killed his master, he has decided to kill all of the warlords not just as a trial-and-error method to bring Shadya back, but also to get revenge on all of them for getting away with their injustices.\nIn spite of this, Akshan favors justice at heart, and fights to defend people who can't defend themselves, and his resolve prevents him from losing his morals and letting his vindictiveness get the better of him. He cares about his master Shadya the most, and ultimately wants to bring Shadya back to life.\nShadya was the mentor and superior of Akshan. She revived Akshan with the use of the Absolver from the clutches of brutal warlords, recognizing his potential and dedication to fighting injustice. As a member of the Sentinels of Light , Shadya imparted her knowledge and skills to Akshan, forging a strong bond between them. However, their relationship becomes strained when Shadya withholds information about the Absolver, a powerful relic gun she once used to save Akshan's life. Shadya's death at the hands of an unknown warlord becomes the catalyst for Akshan's journey of vengeance.\nLucian is a seasoned Sentinel of Light in search of the Absolver, a weapon that could both kill and revive. Initially seeking the relic for its potential in combating the Wraiths , Lucian encounters Akshan, who shares the story of Shadya's murder and his mission for retribution. Although Lucian attempts to recruit Akshan to the Sentinel cause, the young and vengeful Akshan remains resolute in his personal quest. Lucian's interactions with Akshan reveal a clash of ideologies and priorities, with the seasoned Sentinel trying to instill a sense of duty in the determined and rebellious Akshan. Akshan has mentioned that he sees a lot of Shadya in Lucian .\nAkshan's initial encounter with Senna is met with mixed reactions by the commanding officer of the Sentinels of Light . She scolds Akshan for his dress code violations and is not sure this young Sentinel is up for the task. He would prove her wrong by mercy-killing Isolde , thereby bringing back Senna and Gwen from death.\nVayne's initial reaction to Akshan's recruitment is met with disdain, wanting to kill him for his brash remarks towards her and other members of the Sentinels of Light . After sealing of Viego , she and him would stand on neutral terms, recognizing his abilities."}

Shadya's death at the hands of an unknown warlord becomes the catalyst for Akshan's journey of vengeance.\nLucian is a seasoned Sentinel of Light in search of the Absolver, a weapon that could both kill and revive. Initially seeking the relic for its potential in combating the Wraiths , Lucian encounters Akshan, who shares the story of Shadya's murder and his mission for retribution. Although Lucian attempts to recruit Akshan to the Sentinel cause, the young and vengeful Akshan remains resolute in his personal quest. Lucian's interactions with Akshan reveal a clash of ideologies and priorities, with the seasoned Sentinel trying to instill a sense of duty in the determined and rebellious Akshan. Akshan has mentioned that he sees a lot of Shadya in Lucian .\nAkshan's initial encounter with Senna is met with mixed reactions by the commanding officer of the Sentinels of Light . She scolds Akshan for his dress code violations and is not sure this young Sentinel is up for the task. He would prove her wrong by mercy-killing Isolde , thereby bringing back Senna and Gwen from death.\nVayne's initial reaction to Akshan's recruitment is met with disdain, wanting to kill him for his brash remarks towards her and other members of the Sentinels of Light .

Though he was enslaved and forced into the life of a gladiator, his unbreakable will was what kept him from truly becoming a beast. Now, free of the chains of his former masters, he fights in the name of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged, his rage as much a weapon as his horns, hooves and fists.\nAlistar grew up in the Minotaur clans of the Great Barrier mountains. Historically, these Minotaurs protected the overland trade routes to Zaun , gaining a fearsome reputation as strong beasts but preferring to to avoid Valoran's wider political conflicts.\nAlistar was known as a noble warrior and respected among all the clans. Despite this, he always urged his kin to forge greater bonds with the other races, wishing to reach out to them. Unfortunately, most civilizations saw Minotaurs as nothing but beasts and monsters, souring their relations with outsiders.\nWhen the Noxian empire came to the Great Barrier, they requested a parley with representatives from the Minotaur clans. The emissary of Noxus, a matriarch of House Tewain, stated that the empire was preparing to take the eastern coastal city of Basilich and could not go through with it without the support of the Minotaur clans. While many of the Minotaurs were eager to accept her offer and join Noxus, seeing this as a way to gain power and recognition, Alistar remained skeptical. Having encountered Noxian scouts previously, Alistar knew them to be duplicitous and cunning people, and so was incredibly distrustful of the potential invaders. Hearing Tewain's call for support from the Minotaurs, Alistar's clan sent him and fifty of their mightiest warriors to personally meet the matriarch and reject her alliance on behalf of the clan.\nWhen Alistar arrived to announce his clan's position on the issue, he discovered that most of the larger Minotaur clans had already pledged themselves to Noxus. Now seeing Alistar and his clan as opposition to the Noxian empire, the clan representatives betrayed Alistar, attacking him and his warriors for their new Noxian masters. In the swift and brutal battle, Alistar managed to kill many of the Noxian soldiers and traitorous Minotaurs, even choking the life out of Lady Tewain. Despite this, Alistar and his surviving warriors were captured and relocated to the the Noxian capital, accused of the crime of inciting rebellion within the empire.\nCast as Reckoners in the arenas of the city, Alistar and his warriors became part of a gruesome, bloodthirsty event called the Fleshing; a twenty-one day festival of non-stop fights within the Reckoners' arenas. Despite telling his warriors to not fight back and sate the bloodlust these Noxian spectators wanted to see, Alistar became the last of his tribe standing by the end of the festival. Afterwards, Alistar was constantly hated and feared by the Noxians, forced to fight and act like the beast they all assumed he was. Driven to madness, Alistar began to accept the bestial nature these Noxians forced on him, losing memories of his own home with every gruesome kill.\nOne day Ayelia, a servant girl in one of the arenas, visited the infamously savage Reckoner in his cell. He bellowed and charged the bars of his cage, expecting her to fear or goad him like every other visitor he'd had, but Ayelia instead treated him with the first act of kindness Alistar had seen in many years. She returned every day and spoke to him with gentle respect until Alistar managed to reply, revealing the true kindness in him that the Noxian spectators never seen. Through their many talks, Alistar sympathized with Ayelia as he learned that her homeland, much like Alistar's, was also claimed by Noxus. By seeing Alistar's suffering as an enslaved Reckoner, Ayelia had finally been convinced to leave the city and planned to take Alistar with her. While formulating a plan to escape, Alistar's memories of his home began to return to him, remembering the home he wished to return to instead of the awful betrayal by the other tribes.\nAyelia brought Alistar the key to his cell, beginning their escape plan. They hurried to a river where a cargo barge awaited them, ready to sail them away from the city. Unfortunately, Noxian agents burst from the shadows just as they boarded and began to attack. Eager to protect his only living friend Ayelia, Alistar hurled himself directly into battle but became, once again, lost in his own rage and bloodlust. Ayelia constantly called out to Alistar to calm him down and escape with her, but he was too blinded by his rage to hear or notice her calls.\nBy the time Alistar had slain the attackers, the cargo boat had already left and Ayelia was missing. Now without the boat, Alistar fled south on foot instead in search of Ayelia, fearing she had been captured or killed.\nWeeks after Alistar's escape, a political coup lead by the disgraced general Jericho Swain shook the empire to its core, leading to massive reforms in the political structure of Noxus and the culture of the Reckoning arenas. Because of this, the event of Alistar's violent escape from the arenas was mostly forgotten.\nAlistar continues to travel alone through Noxian territories as quietly and subtley as he can in fear of being found out for his crimes. In every city, Alistar incites rebellion and fights to protect the people oppressed by the cruel Noxian regime. With every act of kindness he shows the downtrodden of these territories, Alistar hopes to clear the shame he feels from the horrific acts he committed as a Reckoner. In every city Alistar passes through, he asks for Ayelia, continuing his search for the servant girl responsible for freeing him all those years ago.\nAlistar is a purple skinned Minotaur with blue tufts of hair, blood red eyes, and large white horns atop his head. He is gargantuan and very muscular even by Minotaur standards, with a notably large torso and giant fists. He wears nothing but a loincloth around his waist and broken chain cuffs around his wrists.\nAlistar is a fighter, and his goal is to fight against Noxus in the name of all he has lost and all those that have lost much too. He is angry, wanting Noxus to fall and inciting rebellion in Noxian territories. Despite this, Alistar has a kind heart, and is intent on finding Ayelia at all costs, as she was one of the few people who showed kindness to him.\nAfter being captured and turned into a Reckoner for the arenas of the Noxian capital, Ayelia would visit Alistar in his cage every day as the first person to show the tortured and enslaved Minotaur true kindness. The two would slowly kindle a true friendship, sympathizing with the fact that both of them had lost their homes to the brutal expansions of the Noxian empire. Ayelia and Alistar eventually hatched an escape plan, managing to escape to a nearby cargo boat. Before they could escape, Noxians discovered the two and caused Alistar to enter a brutal rage in order to protect Ayelia, blindly fighting them off as she attempted to calm him down and call him to the now sailing boat. By the time Alistar regained his consciousness, Ayelia was gone along with the boat. Not knowing whether or not she had been killed or captured, Alistar fled southward by foot and, while inciting riots in Noxian territories, continually searches for and asks for Ayelia, intent on finding her."}

She also the ex-mentor of the wandering Noxus warrior Rell.\nWhen Ambessa was ten, her father brought her to the aftermath of the Battle of Hildenard to collect weapons from the fallen in exchange for a gold coin each, exposing her to death at the tender age. Even at her young age, she realized death was not just something to be feared but also to be respected. As she grew up, she chose a soldier's life, quickly rising to the ranks to become a general in command of several warbands. She became a mother of her firstborn son, Kino. While she loved him greatly, she realized he would never have the strength of a warrior in his heart.\nNot long after the birth of Kino, Ambessa almost met her end in defending her ancestral home of Rokrund. As she lay among the bodies she was discovered by a lone wolf who gave her visions as she drifted near death, which miraculously brought her back to life. [ 2 ] The visions that Ambessa saw that day had strengthened her resolve and ambition: She would bend the world to her will so that any weakness her children might have could not be exploited. When her grandfather, Menelik Medarda, passed away, he had named no heir. Several branches of the family had vied for succession, however they were all outmatched by Ambessa. She vowed to forge a legacy worthy of the Medarda name.\nShe tried to imbue the same principles in her two known children, particularly in her daughter Mel , whom Ambessa tried to mold into a warrior and leader willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure their survival from a young age. This seemingly proved futile, however, as her son Kino preferred diplomacy and dismissed war as \"A failure of statecraft\", and Mel adapted his way of thinking, considering war and killing only as a last resort.\nEventually, she sent Mel away from their home to Piltover , pointing out that her sentimentality would work well among the \"soft-spined idealists\", and would later use the excuse that it was for her to oversee their family's interests in the city. [ 3 ] In truth, she sent her away because she could no longer bear Mel's disapproval of her decisions. [ 4 ]\nAs an old guard of Boram Darkwill's regime, she disapproves of Swain's rule and his Triferian council, citing his rule is weak. Furthermore, she is known to look down on Darius as she often refers him as a witless brute. Despite this, she had shown to have genuine respect toward Swain and even called him as \"a true general\" unlike Darkwill. Therefore, it is possible that she seemed to only dislike how he ruled Noxus.\nSometime in the past, she encountered a warrior girl named Rell and was impressed with her fighting capabilities that she decided to take Rell in as a protege and part of her warband. During the battle between Ambessa and her niece, Rell magic surfaced and she helped Ambessa defeated her niece and her forece. Ambessa demanded Rell to kill her niece as a test of loyalty, which Rell complied. However, before Ambessa could officially inducted Rell into her force, Leblanc snatched Rell from her and Ambessa lost her greatest protege back then.\nMel eventually came to power in Piltover as a Councilor and the wealthiest person in the city, [ 5 ] and she would later sponsor the research of Jayce Talis , whose Hextech enterprise revolutionized trade and travel around the world; thus having a hand in Piltover's undeniable progress. [ 6 ]\nApparently too distracted to have been able to do anything at the time, her son Kino was killed by a powerful man who Kino offended. [ 3 ] Ambessa realized that the man was not done with his grudge and would strike again and could have enough resources to potentially overpower the Medarda family. [ 4 ] To aid their victory in a potential war, Ambessa visited Piltover in hopes of getting her hands on weaponized Hextech.\nHaving heard news of the city's ongoing conflict with Zaun , she tried to convince both Mel and Jayce to finally engage the undercity in war and use his Hextech weapons for it. Mel determinedly refused and convinced the Council to avoid any war-inciting actions as well, but Jayce was swayed enough to attack one of Silco's Shimmer factories with Vi . When Jayce accidentally killed a boy, [ 3 ] however, Jayce completely changed his mind.\nMel confronted her about her manipulation of Jayce and she finally told Mel about the impending conflict with Kino's killer at Noxus. She then asked Mel to let the war happen, after which she would be welcome back home and at her side. Mel would ultimately turn down the offer, taking off her family ring as she agreed to Jayce's proposal of peace with Zaun by granting them their requested independence. [ 4 ]\nAmbessa is a muscular, brown-skinned woman with light brown eyes. She has coily hair in varying shades of grey to black, worn loosely above the shoulders. She wears Noxian styled clothing befitting her rank, mostly made up of black and red colours, with metallic silver elements, and a red cloak with black fur worn to one side. She is shown to have numerous battle scars on her face and upper body.\nAmbessa is a confident person, showing no shame or emotional weaknesses. Merciless to her enemies, she prefers aggression over passivity due to the way her father brought her up and the Noxian culture she was raised in. Accompanying her ruthlessness is brazen indulgence, freely enjoying the decadence of Piltover and the local cuisines of foreign lands.  Eloquent and well-versed, particularly in military history, she is as capable of manipulation as she is capable of violence, so long as it serves her, and her family’s, interests.\nDespite her relaxed stance on using violence, Ambessa does not appear to disregard diplomacy entirely, as despite Kino adopting a purely diplomatic philosophy, Kino was not exiled like Mel was.  Additionally, Ambessa is selective with her violence, expressing a readiness to kill one if it means avoiding a larger conflict in the future.  She is a survivalist above all else, willing to do whatever it takes to protect her clan, and more importantly, her family.\nAmbessa is one who respects aggression in any form, either in diplomacy or in war, but she also values cunning and guile, so long as it does not detract from a show of force.  Ambessa describes this to Mel as a need for her to embody \"both the fox and the wolf\".  Although one can embody an aspect of one or the other, one cannot succeed in her family without embodying both, but the most atrocious offense to her is a showcase of weakness and ineptitude.\nMel Medarda was exiled from the Medarda Clan after Ambessa accused her of harboring weakness that was unbecoming of the Clan.  Although for years it was assumed Ambessa exiled her for that reason alone, it is later claimed by Ambessa that she exiled Mel to prevent her from influencing her ruthless decision making and weakening her; something she could not permit to happen to anyone in her family, including herself.\nAmbessa continuously holds Mel to these standards, however, even after Mel's exile, dismissing her emotional outburst and saying she taught her better than to let her emotions run loose.  Even so, Ambessa holds a soft spot for Mel with a desire to protect the family and sought to have her rejoin the Medarda Clan after Kino's death.\nAlthough Ambessa was dismissive of Kino's purely diplomatic approach to statecraft, he was not exiled like Mel was, which suggests that Ambessa believes Kino's philosophy isn't wholly wrong, simply incomplete.\nWhen Ambessa delivers the news of Kino's death to Mel, Ambessa shows dismay over his loss, believing she was too distracted to prevent his death from occurring.\nAmbessa addresses Elora by name upon arriving to Piltover.  Their relationship is unknown, but they are at the very least acquainted with one another.\nAmbessa uses Jayce to try and incite war between Piltover and Zaun, and put Jayce into a position to develop Hextech weaponry.  Once developed, Ambessa  wishes to use them for her Clan to ensure that the Noxian that Kino crossed with doesn't slaughter the rest of the Medarda Family as revenge.\nAmbessa uses Jayce and manipulates him into impulsively acting against Zaun, which succeeds.  When Mel confronts Ambessa about her manipulation of Jayce, she is indifferent about this fact.  Jayce is simply a means to an end.\nRell is Ambessa's former protoge after she takes a liking to her fighting skill and magic. Ambessa sees Rell is not just as an asset but also a daughter she wishes Mel to be. She wishes for Rell to become her successor in case Mel could not or both Rell and Mel could become a powerful sister duo for Ambessa to gain power and take down the Black Rose.

She also the ex-mentor of the wandering Noxus warrior Rell.\nWhen Ambessa was ten, her father brought her to the aftermath of the Battle of Hildenard to collect weapons from the fallen in exchange for a gold coin each, exposing her to death at the tender age. Even at her young age, she realized death was not just something to be feared but also to be respected. As she grew up, she chose a soldier's life, quickly rising to the ranks to become a general in command of several warbands. She became a mother of her firstborn son, Kino. While she loved him greatly, she realized he would never have the strength of a warrior in his heart.\nNot long after the birth of Kino, Ambessa almost met her end in defending her ancestral home of Rokrund. As she lay among the bodies she was discovered by a lone wolf who gave her visions as she drifted near death, which miraculously brought her back to life. [ 2 ] The visions that Ambessa saw that day had strengthened her resolve and ambition: She would bend the world to her will so that any weakness her children might have could not be exploited. When her grandfather, Menelik Medarda, passed away, he had named no heir. Several branches of the family had vied for succession, however they were all outmatched by Ambessa. She vowed to forge a legacy worthy of the Medarda name.\nShe tried to imbue the same principles in her two known children, particularly in her daughter Mel , whom Ambessa tried to mold into a warrior and leader willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure their survival from a young age. This seemingly proved futile, however, as her son Kino preferred diplomacy and dismissed war as \"A failure of statecraft\", and Mel adapted his way of thinking, considering war and killing only as a last resort.\nEventually, she sent Mel away from their home to Piltover , pointing out that her sentimentality would work well among the \"soft-spined idealists\", and would later use the excuse that it was for her to oversee their family's interests in the city. [ 3 ] In truth, she sent her away because she could no longer bear Mel's disapproval of her decisions. [ 4 ]\nAs an old guard of Boram Darkwill's regime, she disapproves of Swain's rule and his Triferian council, citing his rule is weak. Furthermore, she is known to look down on Darius as she often refers him as a witless brute. Despite this, she had shown to have genuine respect toward Swain and even called him as \"a true general\" unlike Darkwill. Therefore, it is possible that she seemed to only dislike how he ruled Noxus.\nSometime in the past, she encountered a warrior girl named Rell and was impressed with her fighting capabilities that she decided to take Rell in as a protege and part of her warband. During the battle between Ambessa and her niece, Rell magic surfaced and she helped Ambessa defeated her niece and her forece. Ambessa demanded Rell to kill her niece as a test of loyalty, which Rell complied. However, before Ambessa could officially inducted Rell into her force, Leblanc snatched Rell from her and Ambessa lost her greatest protege back then.\nMel eventually came to power in Piltover as a Councilor and the wealthiest person in the city, [ 5 ] and she would later sponsor the research of Jayce Talis , whose Hextech enterprise revolutionized trade and travel around the world; thus having a hand in Piltover's undeniable progress. [ 6 ]\nApparently too distracted to have been able to do anything at the time, her son Kino was killed by a powerful man who Kino offended. [ 3 ] Ambessa realized that the man was not done with his grudge and would strike again and could have enough resources to potentially overpower the Medarda family. [ 4 ] To aid their victory in a potential war, Ambessa visited Piltover in hopes of getting her hands on weaponized Hextech.\nHaving heard news of the city's ongoing conflict with Zaun , she tried to convince both Mel and Jayce to finally engage the undercity in war and use his Hextech weapons for it. Mel determinedly refused and convinced the Council to avoid any war-inciting actions as well, but Jayce was swayed enough to attack one of Silco's Shimmer factories with Vi . When Jayce accidentally killed a boy, [ 3 ] however, Jayce completely changed his mind.\nMel confronted her about her manipulation of Jayce and she finally told Mel about the impending conflict with Kino's killer at Noxus. She then asked Mel to let the war happen, after which she would be welcome back home and at her side. Mel would ultimately turn down the offer, taking off her family ring as she agreed to Jayce's proposal of peace with Zaun by granting them their requested independence. [ 4 ]\nAmbessa is a muscular, brown-skinned woman with light brown eyes. She has coily hair in varying shades of grey to black, worn loosely above the shoulders. She wears Noxian styled clothing befitting her rank, mostly made up of black and red colours, with metallic silver elements, and a red cloak with black fur worn to one side. She is shown to have numerous battle scars on her face and upper body.\nAmbessa is a confident person, showing no shame or emotional weaknesses. Merciless to her enemies, she prefers aggression over passivity due to the way her father brought her up and the Noxian culture she was raised in. Accompanying her ruthlessness is brazen indulgence, freely enjoying the decadence of Piltover and the local cuisines of foreign lands.  Eloquent and well-versed, particularly in military history, she is as capable of manipulation as she is capable of violence, so long as it serves her, and her family’s, interests.\nDespite her relaxed stance on using violence, Ambessa does not appear to disregard diplomacy entirely, as despite Kino adopting a purely diplomatic philosophy, Kino was not exiled like Mel was.  Additionally, Ambessa is selective with her violence, expressing a readiness to kill one if it means avoiding a larger conflict in the future.  She is a survivalist above all else, willing to do whatever it takes to protect her clan, and more importantly, her family.\nAmbessa is one who respects aggression in any form, either in diplomacy or in war, but she also values cunning and guile, so long as it does not detract from a show of force.  Ambessa describes this to Mel as a need for her to embody \"both the fox and the wolf\".  Although one can embody an aspect of one or the other, one cannot succeed in her family without embodying both, but the most atrocious offense to her is a showcase of weakness and ineptitude.\nMel Medarda was exiled from the Medarda Clan after Ambessa accused her of harboring weakness that was unbecoming of the Clan.  Although for years it was assumed Ambessa exiled her for that reason alone, it is later claimed by Ambessa that she exiled Mel to prevent her from influencing her ruthless decision making and weakening her; something she could not permit to happen to anyone in her family, including herself.\nAmbessa continuously holds Mel to these standards, however, even after Mel's exile, dismissing her emotional outburst and saying she taught her better than to let her emotions run loose.  Even so, Ambessa holds a soft spot for Mel with a desire to protect the family and sought to have her rejoin the Medarda Clan after Kino's death.\nAlthough Ambessa was dismissive of Kino's purely diplomatic approach to statecraft, he was not exiled like Mel was, which suggests that Ambessa believes Kino's philosophy isn't wholly wrong, simply incomplete.\nWhen Ambessa delivers the news of Kino's death to Mel, Ambessa shows dismay over his loss, believing she was too distracted to prevent his death from occurring.\nAmbessa addresses Elora by name upon arriving to Piltover.  Their relationship is unknown, but they are at the very least acquainted with one another.\nAmbessa uses Jayce to try and incite war between Piltover and Zaun, and put Jayce into a position to develop Hextech weaponry.  Once developed, Ambessa  wishes to use them for her Clan to ensure that the Noxian that Kino crossed with doesn't slaughter the rest of the Medarda Family as revenge.\nAmbessa uses Jayce and manipulates him into impulsively acting against Zaun, which succeeds.  When Mel confronts Ambessa about her manipulation of Jayce, she is indifferent about this fact.  Jayce is simply a means to an end.\nRell is Ambessa's former protoge after she takes a liking to her fighting skill and magic. Ambessa sees Rell is not just as an asset but also a daughter she wishes Mel to be. She wishes for Rell to become her successor in case Mel could not or both Rell and Mel could become a powerful sister duo for Ambessa to gain power and take down the Black Rose. After Rell was taken away by the Black Rose, Ambessa hatred toward them even more amplified.\nAmbessa believes the Council lacks agency against the Zaunite threat, and allowed the problem to accumulate over years, doing nothing to prevent its advance.  Ambessa tells Jayce that the Council is at risk of letting themselves get blindsided by Zaun in an upcoming war, and that he would need to properly prepare for war if they were to avoid this fate.\nDespite her great respect toward him in the past, Ambessa detests Swain and sees his regime is not as strong as the old regime of Boram Darkwill. She often refers him as the man with vision but has no foresight.\nDespite Darius's achievements within Noxus, Ambessa looks down on Darius and sees him as an arrogant brute with no cunning.\nLike with Darius, she looks down on Draven but much more as she refers him as filth and going as far to pity Darius for having a brother like him.\nShe holds great respect of Samira and hopes to challenge her some day.\nShe despises Riven and calls her as a pathetic traitor of Noxus.\nVideo\nArcane (TV Series)\nEvery legend has a beginning.\nStarring: Aero , Amara , Ambessa , Babette , Benzo , Billingsworth , Bolbok , Caitlyn , Cassandra , Chross , Claggor , Deckard , Ekko , Elora , Finn , Gorgeous Man , Grayson , Harold , Heimerdinger , Hoskel , Huck , Jayce , Jericho , Jinx , Jules , LeBlanc , Lock , Marcus , Margot , Mel , Mylo , Pim , Ren , Renni , Salo , Sevika , Shoola , Silco , Singed , Sky , Smeech , Thieram , Tobias , Vander , Verne , Vi , Viktor , Warwick , Ximena\nMentioned: Janna , Teemo"}

Doomed by an ancient curse to remain alone forever, his touch is death, his affection ruin. Those who claim to have seen him describe a living cadaver, small in stature and wrapped in creeping bandages. Amumu has inspired myths, songs, and folklore told and retold for generations such that it is impossible to separate truth from fiction.\nStories about Amumu have circulated around Shuriman culture for centuries but his true origins are an enigma and the subject of debate. Shurimans have told countless origin stories about Amumu but the validity of these tales is uncertain as nobody can agree on a single story. Some people claim that Amumu was a young undead prince while others claim he's a wandering spirit , but the most likely explanation is that Amumu is actually a Yordle who has embedded himself into Shuriman culture, though even this isn't wholly agreed on.\nBecause Amumu has been a staple figure in Shuriman culture since ancient times, there are countless different stories that mention him throughout history. These stories vary in many ways but one detail is universally seen throughout all of them; Amumu is a mummy cursed with eternal loneliness due to his deadly touch and forced to eternally wander the desert in search of a friend.\nOne of the legends about Amumu connected him to the first ruling family of Shurima, claiming that they were struck by a terrible disease that forced Amumu to quarantine in his chambers. Hearing Amumu's weeping through the walls, a servant girl would often visit Amumu and eventually befriended him, bringing courtly news and tales about her mystic grandmother.\nOne day, the girl brought news that Amumu's eldest brother had died from the illness, making Amumu the official emperor of Shurima. Pitying him for enduring this news alone, the servant girl decided to go into his chambers and comfort him. As Amumu embraced his friend, he realized that his touch had infected her with the same blight that killed his entire family, causing her to die. On the day of her death, the girl's grandmother became enraged and placed a terrible curse on the young emperor, trapping him in a permanent moment of suffering for eternity.\nAnother tale depicted Amumu as a young and cruel emperor who forced his subjects to worship him like a god. The young emperor sought the legendary Eye of Angor, an artifact believed to grant eternal life whoever gazes at it with an unflinching heart. For years Amumu hunted for the relic, being carried by a host of slaves through dangerous catacombs as they were forced to sacrifice themselves to deadly traps under Amumu's command.\nWhen Amumu, borne by his slaves, finally reached the room containing the Eye of Angor, the emperor immediately rushed in to gaze at the artifact. Seizing their opportunity, the slaves escaped and sealed the doorway, trapping the child emperor in darkness. The young Amumu endured darkness for years to the point of insanity as he clawed at his own skin, covering the wounds with bandages. Amumu's life was extended by the Eye of Angor, allowing him to reflect on his past transgressions, but was cursed with eternal loneliness in the process.\nAfter a series of earthquakes shattered the tomb's foundations and opened its doors, Amumu emerged, now completely wrapped in bandages and seeking redemption for the suffering he caused as emperor.\nOne of the most peculiar stories of Amumu claim that he was the first and last Yordle ruler of Shurima. Amumu, being a firm believer in the goodness of the human heart, sought to prove his point and swore an oath to live as a beggar until he made one true friend, convinced that his people would rally to help him. Despite thousands passing him by however, nobody extended a helping hand to the impoverished Amumu as he eventually died of a broken heart. Some say that the Yordle did not truly die however, believing that he continues to wander the desert for eternity, hoping to find someone who can restore his faith in humanity.\nThe legends of Amumu still endure in modern Shurima, even after the death of the last emperor Azir . It's widely believed that Amumu still wanders the desert as his cries echo through the winds while he despairs over his inability to find friendship. Some claim that they have actually encountered the mummy, stating that his very presence brings death and illness at the touch. A song known throughout Valoran as The Curse of the Sad Mummy details Amumu's loneliness as he travels the world in search of a friend. By the end of the song, it's said that Amumu's fragile soul couldn't bear the curse anymore as he unleashed a destructive tantrum, destroying the town as he was tragically left alone once again. [ 1 ]\nThough its unclear what Amumu is looking for, whether it's redemption, companionship or just a simple act of kindness towards him, his quest remains unfulfilled as he continues to shamble around the sands aimlessly.\nThough many still claim to encounter Amumu to this day, one storyteller named Khaldun stated that he stumbled upon Amumu's tomb after it cracked open during an earthquake. Traversing the tomb, he saw wall carvings that detailed Amumu's life with images depicting a young boy sitting atop the Shuriman Sun Disc and another carving depicting his deathbed being surrounded by people either mourning or celebrating.\nAfter hearing the wails of what he thought was a lost child, he stumbled upon puddles of salt water , which he thought was impossible to find so deep underneath the deserts, and eventually Amumu, who hid himself in the shadows and refused to come out. Khaldun felt pity for him and asked if he was lost while Amumu simply replied that he was unsure of where he was or how he got there, having lost his memory over the thousands of years. Khaldun approached closer to comfort him until he realized that the young boy was in fact a mummy. As Amumu's bandaged hand grasped onto Khaldun's arm, he asked if he could be his friend while Khaldun looked at his arm in horror, watching it rapidly decompose to the point of completely falling off.\nKhaldun quickly fled the tomb out of fear, leaving it open and supposedly releasing Amumu to wander the desert. Though the validity of this story is in question, Khaldun lived to tell this story to his grandchildren as an explanation to why he is missing an arm. [ 2 ]\nAmumu is short in stature, about the size of a young child and completely covered head to toe in dark green bandages. He has a permanently despaired facial expression as his yellow eyes constantly tear up as he cries.\nBecause of his curse, Amumu is doomed to an eternity of anguish, despair and loneliness. Because of his deadly touch, Amumu is incapable of embracing or befriending other people, forced to wander the deserts in a constant search for a true friend and wailing as he does so.\nThough the validity of his tale is unclear, an old storyteller named Khaldun claims to his grandchildren that he survived an encounter with Amumu, having delved into his tomb and accidentally left it open once he escaped. According to Khaldun, Amumu's cursed touch withered away his arm with decay, being the reason behind his missing arm to this day. [ 2 ]"}

A demigod born of unforgiving ice and bitter winds, she wields those elemental powers to thwart any who dare disturb her homeland. Anivia guides and protects the tribes of the harsh north, who revere her as a symbol of hope, and a portent of great change. She fights with every ounce of her being, knowing that through her sacrifice, her memory will endure, and she will be reborn into a new tomorrow.\nAnivia is an ancient demi-god who represents the eternal cycle of life, death, rebirth and the changing of the seasons. She, along with her many siblings, sprung from Runeterra during its formation and together they began to forge the lands of the Vorrijaard itself. Anivia's birth in particular is believed to have brought the first winters into the world, with some even claiming she is responsible for creating True Ice .\nWhen the first mortals arrived in the ancient Vorrijaard, Anivia welcomed them willingly. Witnessing their fragility to the cold weather, she sheltered and guided them to secluded valleys where they would establish their own tribal communities and harden themselves to the elements. While nurturing and watching over these tribes, the mortals would come to revere and worship her and her siblings as gods. Legends state that, though she hoped that these tribes would remain united, blood-feuds and infighting made them susceptible to a massive invasion from a greedy king in the south who marched through the mountains seeking to claim the wild magic of the Vorrijaard for himself. Anivia, angered by the outsiders, summoned a massive snowstorm that lasted a century, obliterating the ancient army.\nA young mortal woman named Lissandra , alongside her two sisters Avarosa and Serylda, sought to harness the magics of the world and claim dominion over the entire Vorrijaard. In order to do so, each sister scoured the world for ancient powers to harness with Lissandra seeking to tame the wild magic of the land itself. [ 1 ] Anivia's brothers Valhir and 8 Ildhaurg however grew angered by Lissandra's defiance and sought to destroy the three sisters for their transgressions. Anivia however, alongside her other siblings, was more inclined to work with the sisters rather than declare a war. [ 2 ]\nAfter the eldest sister Lissandra made a pact with otherworldly masters , these three sisters would form a mighty alliance and lead a horde of warriors called the Iceborn . These powerful mortals were attuned to elemental magics of the ice, capable of wielding and utilizing the True Ice substance and practically immune to the frigid cold of the Vorrijaard, now called the Freljord . [ 1 ]\nAs Lissandra and her sisters gained power and marched with their armies, they slowly erased the influences of the Freljordian demi-gods in favor of venerating the Three Sisters as goddesses, affecting the worship of Anivia and her siblings over time.\nIt's believed that even death cannot touch Anivia herself, as many stories tell of how she had been struck down a handful of times throughout history, always followed by a magnificent rebirth—for as long as the Freljord exists, her soul remains immortal. Each rebirth may take hundreds or thousands of years before she rises again, but they always coincide with the dawn of a new era for the Freljord, causing her appearance to be both a wondrous blessing as well as an omen of great or terrible changes on the horizon.\nLegend has it that Anivia once sacrificed herself against a march of towering Balestriders , colossal and ancient creatures now corrupted by the influence of Lissandra. [ 3 ] Though she was incapable of truly slaying these creatures, she instead plunged into the ice beneath their feet and shattered her own body, entombing them beneath the ice and snow.\nAnivia is ancient enough to have witnessed countless mortal civilizations and is highly revered to by many tribal communities of the Freljord. Many stories and legends have been told in Anivia's honor, cementing her as a staple for most of Freljordian mythology and culture.\nOne of the oldest stories of Anivia tells of how her brother Ornn felled one of her favorite perching trees to build his house the Horn Hall. Annoyed by this, Anivia sought to prank her brother by tickling his nose with her feathers as he slept, causing him to sneeze out a gout of flame and setting his bedsheets on fire. Anivia, panicked by the blaze of fire building in the wooden house, flapped her wings to fly away and accidentally stoked the fire even hotter within the dry Freljordian air, causing all of Horn Hall to light ablaze. Ornn woke up on top of a pile of ashes in a bad mood, feeling disturbed in his sleep but unaware of the prank Anivia did on him, something she hasn't told him to this day. [ 4 ]\nThe nomadic Notai highly revere Anivia, traveling along the waves of frost believed to spill from Anivia's massive wings. [ 5 ] Well known for their songs and storytelling, the Notai have many songs that detail Anivia's magnificent birth; bursting from a giant egg of ice and hurling tiny shards into the sky to eventually fall as snow.\nAnother tribe, called the Mourncrow, have sagas telling how the frigid winds and blizzards that scour the Freljord actually originate from the first beats of Anivia's wings when she first birthed into the world.\nThe Avarosan tribe have a legend about an Iceborn warmother named Ulla Shatter-Spear, who was favored by Anivia herself for saving a young Hawk from a Rimefang Wolf . Throughout Ulla's life, Anivia protected her from harm until she finally fell in battle after witnessing a hundred winters. After her death, Ulla's soul was welcomed by Anivia herself with wings spread wide.\nAnivia has reemerged from her egg once more, marking the start of a new era for the Freljord and bringing great change. She most recently appeared before Ashe , who continued her deceased mother Grena's search for the mythical Throne of Avarosa. Ashe, now the new warmother of the Avarosan tribe, is seen by Anivia as the one who can finally reunite the tribes of the Freljord and thus has somewhat gained the favor of the Cryophoenix. [ 6 ]\nWith Anivia's return to the Freljord, more and more shamans and spirit walkers of the old demi-gods feel her presence and the new era she heralds to the Freljord, though they are unsure of what great threat she has come to face.\nAnivia is massive eagle-like creature composed entirely of crystalline blue ice. She also has a single fuchsia crystal on her forehead. Her egg form is an icy globe which glows with white magic and appears swaddled in a nest of icy spikes.\nRevered by both the Notai and the Yeti of old, Anivia is seen as a benevolent guardian deity. In Freljordian legends, she has noteably be an advocate for forgiveness and unity among all of the Freljord's people. The Notai and the Yeti have been called her \"children\" by her brothers before, hinting at her more nurturing nature. She also advocates diplomacy before war, as seen when she advises her kin to work together with the Three Sisters.\nWhile she is a peaceful being, she is not a pacifist. She has notably defended the Freljord from outside forces like Southerners who seek to claim the Vorrijaard as their own as well as Voidborn and the Watchers that created them, who threaten Runeterra itself. While she is unable to die, she is willing to sacrifice herself in order to save the Freljord from annihilation.\nAnivia is one of the Freljordian demi-gods responsible for creating and forging the very land itself. All of the gods are siblings with one another, with Anivia being among one of the older ones. Anivia has not shown any true ill will to any of her fellow gods and is related to deities such as the Seal Sister and other currently unnamed spirits.\nOrnn is the eldest of the Freljordian demi-gods, being the god of the forge and magma. Ornn doesn't socialize with his siblings very much but hasn't shown any ill will towards Anivia. However, there are legends within the Freljord that tell of how Anivia, after Ornn felled her favorite perching tree, pulled a prank on Ornn in his sleep, causing him to sneeze a gout of flame and burn his house down. The legend states that he woke up in a grumpy mood, unaware of what Anivia had done. [ 4 ]\nThe mighty Volibear, also known as Valhir , is the Freljordian demi-god of storms and warfare. Volibear interacted with Anivia when he called his siblings together to declare war on the ice witch Lissandra . Many of the gods, especially Anivia, actually denied Volibear's proposal of war and was more inclined to cooperate with the mortals. [ 2 ] Despite this, and despite his violent nature, Volibear actually highly respects Anivia as a goddess.\nThough it's unsure whether or not Anivia has personally interacted with Lissandra, she is the one who moved to make peace with her instead of declaring war like her brother Volibear proposed. Anivia felt the ice witch's presence when she rallied her army of Iceborn to claim dominion over the Freljord, as followers of the old gods began to die out in her crusade to wipe out all of their worshippers. [ 1 ]\nAnivia hasn't personally interacted with Ashe, but she did appear before her at the mythical Avarosa's Throne, where Ashe found her signature True Ice bow. [ 6 ] Recently, word has spread that Ashe has actually gained the favor of Anivia herself as she sees in Ashe a way to truly reunite the Freljord.\nThe Notai tribe highly revere Anivia in particular, having many stories and songs passed down for generations that speak of her many deeds and detailing her magnificent birth and rebirth within the world. They are nomadic and travel by following wherever the snow may fall, traveling along the waves of frost believed to fall off of Anivia's wings as she flies. [ 5 ]\nNunu hasn't personally met Anivia but was born within the Notai tribe where he heard many stories and songs about her, particularly from his mom Layka. [ 5 ]\nAs the most powerful spirit walker in the Freljord, Udyr is easily capable of channeling the powers of all the Freljordian spirits including Anivia herself. [ 7 ] When channeling Anivia, Udyr enters his Storm Stance , gaining the ice magic of the Cryophoenix herself."}

Even in the shadows of the mountains north of Noxus , she is a magical outlier. Her natural affinity for fire manifested early in life through unpredictable, emotional outbursts, though she eventually learned to control these tricks. Her favorite includes the summoning of her beloved teddy bear, Tibbers , as a fiery beast hellbent on destruction. Lost in the perpetual innocence of childhood, Annie wanders the dark forests, always looking for someone to play with.\nAnnie was born to Gregori Hastur and Amoline Kiosar , two mages that fled the capital city of Noxus due to their uncertainty of Boram Darkwill's rule. Unbeknownst to Gregori, Amoline was actually a runaway from the 1 Ravenbloom Conservatory , a school run by the Black Rose where she was experimentally fused with a Demon named Tybaulk . [ 1 ]\nThe couple made a home in the Ironspike Mountains and Amolie became pregnant. In anticipation for her child's birth, Amoline crafted a stuffed teddy bear based off of the mysterious shadow bears rumored to roam the lands around them. As she applied finishing touches to the toy, Amoline suddenly went into labor and gave birth to Annie.\nAs a newborn, Annie was given the teddy bear that her mother made for her. When Annie was a toddler, she and her father got ill with a fever that was so hot that Amoline couldn't even touch her. Amoline tried using ice water from the river to ease her daughter's fever but became desperate, resorting to using the powers of the demon Tybaulk to save her. By infusing the demon into Annie's stuffed bear, Annie's illness was magically cured at the cost of Amoline's own life. Gregori woke up the next day, Annie in her crib, cured of her fever and playing with her stuffed bear she now named Tibbers . Amoline however was nowhere to be seen.\nGrowing up, Annie's latent magical abilities began to manifest, allowing her to manipulate the flames of the fireplace without her father noticing. Annie naïvely believed that her mother would return one day, and could often be found sitting by the fireplace in her mother's rocking chair and clutching Tibbers tightly while waiting for her mother's return.\nCrayon drawings depicting Tibbers and Annie's birth mom Amoline.\nAs more people began settling around the Ironspike Mountains, Gregori fell in love with one of these settlers named Leanna , who had a daughter of her own named Daisy . Gregori soon married Leanna and the two families joined together, making Leanna Annie's new step-mother. Leanna began to grow disturbed by Annie, often finding her morbid crayon drawings depicting Amoline and Tibbers. Daisy on the other hand grew close with Annie as sisters, but grew terrified of Tibbers and Annie's fire magic, which often sparked from her short temper.\nAnnie and Daisy chasing a Faerie across a river.\nWhile playing outside, the two chased a Faerie around the forest and followed it to a river. Though Annie protested against chasing it across the river, Daisy began skipping on stones to reach the Faerie, losing her balance and slipping. As the waters started to take Daisy, Annie reached out with her bear and allowed her step-sister to grab on. As Daisy held on, Annie's magical abilities began to flare up as Tibbers glowed with a light fire. Frightened by Annie's magic, Daisy panicked and let go of Tibbers, drowning in the river while Annie watched helplessly.\nMourning the death of her step-sister, Annie overheard Leanna as she blamed Annie and called her a monster to Gregori's face. Overwhelmed with grief and emotion, Annie ran to her room and sobbed as she slowly lost control of her magic, setting her room on fire. Soon the entire house caught aflame as Gregori ran into his daughter's room and carried her out of the burning house. As the house began to collapse, some rubble from the ceiling began to fall, forcing Gregori to throw Annie to safety as he sacrificed himself to save her, getting crushed to death by the falling rubble.\nAnnie standing on top of the ashes of her house, orphaned and clutching Tibbers.\nAs the whole house was in ashes, Leanna violently expressed her spite towards Annie, vocally blaming her for everything. As Leanna snatched Tibbers away from Annie, she tried to tear the bear apart out of anger, triggering Annie's full rage as she manifested the demonic Tybaulk by animating her teddy bear for the first time, viciously tearing Leanna into pieces. Now, completely alone, traumatized and orphaned, Annie wandered off into the countryside with only her bear Tibbers to keep her company. [ 2 ]\nAnnie wandered the northern parts of Noxus while avoiding the capital city, believing that most city Noxians would be similar to her hated step-mother. Occasionally on her travels, Annie would use her adorable exterior to convince a family to take her in and care for her, which would usually end in a fire and death when anyone tries to separate Annie from her stuffed bear. At some point, Annie was adopted by a family who gave her a new set of clothes; her signature pink and purple outfit along with her horned tiara. It's unknown what happened to them, but they are presumed to have been killed by Annie's uncontrollable fire magic.\nAt some point, Annie ended up at a tavern run by a bartender named Marcin. Ominously, Annie skipped through the tavern doors and asked Marcin for a cup of milk, which Marcin was confused by but complied anyway. As he got the girl a cup of milk, Annie paid with a full bag of coins that was more than necessary for payment. A nearby bounty hunter overheard and caught glimpse of the large sum of gold, demanding to know where she found so much money. As the bounty hunter continued to provoke the young girl, Annie unleashed Tibbers, who immediately shredded the man apart and set the tavern on fire. Annie happily thanked the bartender before walking out as the entire structure crumbled into ashes. [ 3 ]\nAfter hearing rumors about a girl with fire magic roaming the northern Ironspike Mountains, the Ravenbloom Conservatory sent a scout named Fynn Retrick to investigate. Fynn, who personally knew Amoline in the past, found Annie and immediately recognized her as Amoline's daughter. Having been sent to retrieve the demon Tybaulk and realizing what Amoline had done with Annie, Fynn brought Annie back to the school with him to be enrolled as their newest student. [ 4 ]\nIn the conservatory, Annie befriended most of her classmates, all of whom were youths wielding magical abilities. This included an Oovi-Kat vastaya named Daani , a boy named Sydell and a prodigy student named Faye . Annie showed a powerful talent for fire magic to the school and became extremely important due to the fact that she was directly linked to Tybaulk, an important asset that the school wished to regain control of. Annie was a temperamental and mischievous student, as her misbehavior proved too difficult for the faculty staff to control and discipline. [ 5 ] Annie's temper eventually got the best of her as she summoned the full force of Tibbers and set the entire school on fire, forcing everybody to evacuate as the academy burned to ashes. [ 6 ]\nShe is a young girl described with a bright-red hair and brilliants green eyes. She wears a infant gothic, with a pink and purple palette. She wears a horned tiara, who gives her the impression of an imp, and has a leather bag on her back. She seems to always carry a innocent and malicious face.\nAnnie is childish and reckless, putting on a display of innocence while showing an unsettling sense of humor at times. She is very protective of Tibbers, seeing him as her best friend, and will not hesitate to animate him to attack whomever tries to harm her or snatches him from her. She is shown to have an indomitable will which impressed Tybaulk (the demon within Tibbers) enough to ally with her.\nTybaulk, known to Annie as 'Tibbers,' is the fire demon trapped within her stuffed teddy bear. Annie's mother Amoline initially contained Tybaulk within her own body, until she eventually placed him within Annie's teddy bear while magically curing her daughter's sudden illness.\nTibbers is Annie's best friend and last companion due to the death of her entire family. Because her teddy bear is the only living piece of Annie's mother she has left, she is extremely fond of him and becomes enraged when someone tries to hurt or separate the two. Tybaulk on the other hand doesn't care much for Annie and serves only as an extension of her powers. However, he is impressed by her strong will as she is the first mortal he's met that has been capable of taming him. [ 7 ]\nGregori was the loving father of Annie, nicknaming her 'Firefly' and raising her for most of her life after Amoline's sudden disappearance. After Gregori remarried, his love for Annie never faltered and he acted as the mediator between Annie and her new stepmother Leanna, who often came to odds with his daughter due to being disturbed by her abilities and strange tendencies. When the house burned down because of Annie's flames, Gregori remained concerned for his daughter's safety, ultimately sacrificing his own life to bring her to safety.\nAmoline was Annie's birth mother and had created Tibbers as a gift to her when she was born, having gone into labor with Annie while stitching the last button eye on the stuffed bear. When Annie gained a terrible fever, Amoline grew desparate to save her daughter from the illness and resorted to infusing her daughter with the powers of the demon Tybaulk to save her, sacrificing her own life and mysteriously disappearing in the process.\nAfter Amoline's disappearance, Annie held on hope that her mother would one day return, constantly waiting for her at the fireplace while drawing pictures of her mother. Her obsession with her mother would grow disturbing however, such as one crayon drawing depicting her mother being buried underground implying she's aware that she most likely passed away. Tibbers is the last remaining piece of Amoline that Annie has left, causing her to be deeply connected to the stuffed bear to the point that anyone attempting to separate them would cause Annie's rageful outbursts.\nDaisy was Annie's stepsister, being the daughter of Leanna. Because the two were similar in age, they often got along and played together, but Daisy became frightened of Annie's temper and fiery powers. She grew a fear of Tibbers due to the fact that, at one point, Annie ignited Tibbers when Daisy attempted to take him to play a game.\nOne fateful day, the two playfully followed a faerie as it flew across a river with dangerously rushing waters. While chasing the faerie, Daisy slipped on a wet rock and struggled to hang on as the powerful currents took hold of her. Annie tried to save Daisy by reaching out to her with Tibbers, unwillingly heating the stuffed bear with fire because of her overwhelming emotions. Daisy, terrified of the toy bear, lost her grip and drowned in the river as Annie watched, horrified. Shortly after, Daisy's mother Leanna vocally blamed Annie for Daisy's death, causing Annie to become overwhelmed with guilt and sadness as she grieved her stepsister's death.\nLeanna is a colonist in the Ironspike Mountains who fell in love and married Gregori Hastur, becoming Annie's stepmother. Annie's continuous obsession for her birth mother Amoline immediately caused a rift between her and Leanna, who in turn grew disturbed by Annie's strange behaviors especially after finding her crayon drawings of Amoline.\nTheir troubled relationship grew as Annie played with Leanna's daughter Daisy, who she would try to protect from Annie due to her temper and fiery magic. After Daisy's tragic death in the river, Leanna told her husband that she completely blamed Annie for her daughter's death, calling her a monster. As Annie overheard Leanna, she became overwhelmed with grief and set the house ablaze without control of her powers, ultimately leading to Gregori's death as he sacrificed himself to save her from the house fire.\nAtop the ashes of the house, Leanna violently lashed out at Annie, blaming her for everything and stating that she took everything from her. In anger, she snatched Tibbers out of the hands of a grieving Annie and attempted to rip him apart out of anger, causing Annie to manifest Tibbers as he viciously tore Leanna to shreds.\nAnnie's birth mother, Amoline, was a former student of the Ravenbloom Conservatory but ran away to the northern parts of Noxus after being infused with the demon Tybaulk. The headmistress of the school, Headmistress Telsi , sent a scout named Fynn Retrick to locate Amoline and retrieve the demon infused with her body. Fynn instead returned with Annie, who they instantly recognized as Amoline's daughter and that she was magically infused with Tybaulk.\nIn the school, Annie was incredibly powerful with her magic considering her young age and lack of training. However, most of the school faculty feared her due to her temper and mischievous, claiming that her misbehaviors made her impossible to teach. Eventually, Annie summoned Tibbers in the school, burning the entire building to ashes as she joyfully skipped away.\nDaani is one of Annie's classmates in the Ravenbloom Conservatory, being a magically talented Oovi-Kat vastaya . He is incredibly playful with Annie and friendly with her, with Annie even considering him her 'second bestfriend.' Daani also seems curious about Tibbers, mostly due to his magical ability to see magical auras and noting that he's never seen a powerful aura around a stuffed bear before.\nSydell Kythera is one of Annie's classmates in the Ravenbloom Conservatory, magically gifted with a connection to spiders such as his pet spider named Fang . The two seem to get along, with Sydell being mischievous delinquent in the school and bonding with Annie over their troublemaking. Though Sydell would rather do things like skip classes, Annie would state that she thinks it'd be more fun to burn the entire school down. Annie calls Sydell Mr. Kythera but often has trouble pronouncing his last name.\nFaye is a prodigy within the Ravenbloom Conservatory and one of Annie's classmates. Wielding powerful telekinetic abilities, she is favored by Headmistress Telsi, who utilizes Faye to influence the students when they become too unruly for the school faculty to control.\nWhen Annie sparred with Faye at the school's training grounds, Faye became interested in her immense power and took a liking to her. Possibly under the orders of the headmistress, Faye would attempt to convince Annie to further her training and expand her powers.\nThough LeBlanc has never met Annie in person, she runs the Black Rose , a secret society within Noxus that truly runs many schools such as the Ravenbloom Conservatory. In this school in particular, the Black Rose experimented with demons, harnessing their powers and infusing one of them within Annie's mother Amoline. When Amoline went missing, it's assumed that the Black Rose are the ones who issued the orders to retrieve both her and their experimented demon.\nAnnie has never met Mordekaiser, but its believed that Tybaulk had initially been enslaved by him during his vicious reign over Noxus, before being harnessed by the Black Rose in the Ravenbloom Conservatory."}

Shortly after, Daisy's mother Leanna vocally blamed Annie for Daisy's death, causing Annie to become overwhelmed with guilt and sadness as she grieved her stepsister's death.\nLeanna is a colonist in the Ironspike Mountains who fell in love and married Gregori Hastur, becoming Annie's stepmother. Annie's continuous obsession for her birth mother Amoline immediately caused a rift between her and Leanna, who in turn grew disturbed by Annie's strange behaviors especially after finding her crayon drawings of Amoline.\nTheir troubled relationship grew as Annie played with Leanna's daughter Daisy, who she would try to protect from Annie due to her temper and fiery magic. After Daisy's tragic death in the river, Leanna told her husband that she completely blamed Annie for her daughter's death, calling her a monster. As Annie overheard Leanna, she became overwhelmed with grief and set the house ablaze without control of her powers, ultimately leading to Gregori's death as he sacrificed himself to save her from the house fire.\nAtop the ashes of the house, Leanna violently lashed out at Annie, blaming her for everything and stating that she took everything from her. In anger, she snatched Tibbers out of the hands of a grieving Annie and attempted to rip him apart out of anger, causing Annie to manifest Tibbers as he viciously tore Leanna to shreds.\nAnnie's birth mother, Amoline, was a former student of the Ravenbloom Conservatory but ran away to the northern parts of Noxus after being infused with the demon Tybaulk. The headmistress of the school, Headmistress Telsi , sent a scout named Fynn Retrick to locate Amoline and retrieve the demon infused with her body. Fynn instead returned with Annie, who they instantly recognized as Amoline's daughter and that she was magically infused with Tybaulk.\nIn the school, Annie was incredibly powerful with her magic considering her young age and lack of training. However, most of the school faculty feared her due to her temper and mischievous, claiming that her misbehaviors made her impossible to teach. Eventually, Annie summoned Tibbers in the school, burning the entire building to ashes as she joyfully skipped away.\nDaani is one of Annie's classmates in the Ravenbloom Conservatory, being a magically talented Oovi-Kat vastaya . He is incredibly playful with Annie and friendly with her, with Annie even considering him her 'second bestfriend.' Daani also seems curious about Tibbers, mostly due to his magical ability to see magical auras and noting that he's never seen a powerful aura around a stuffed bear before.\nSydell Kythera is one of Annie's classmates in the Ravenbloom Conservatory, magically gifted with a connection to spiders such as his pet spider named Fang . The two seem to get along, with Sydell being mischievous delinquent in the school and bonding with Annie over their troublemaking. Though Sydell would rather do things like skip classes, Annie would state that she thinks it'd be more fun to burn the entire school down. Annie calls Sydell Mr. Kythera but often has trouble pronouncing his last name.\nFaye is a prodigy within the Ravenbloom Conservatory and one of Annie's classmates. Wielding powerful telekinetic abilities, she is favored by Headmistress Telsi, who utilizes Faye to influence the students when they become too unruly for the school faculty to control.\nWhen Annie sparred with Faye at the school's training grounds, Faye became interested in her immense power and took a liking to her. Possibly under the orders of the headmistress, Faye would attempt to convince Annie to further her training and expand her powers.\nThough LeBlanc has never met Annie in person, she runs the Black Rose , a secret society within Noxus that truly runs many schools such as the Ravenbloom Conservatory. In this school in particular, the Black Rose experimented with demons, harnessing their powers and infusing one of them within Annie's mother Amoline. When Amoline went missing, it's assumed that the Black Rose are the ones who issued the orders to retrieve both her and their experimented demon.\nAnnie has never met Mordekaiser, but its believed that Tybaulk had initially been enslaved by him during his vicious reign over Noxus, before being harnessed by the Black Rose in the Ravenbloom Conservatory."}

Though fueled by a poison that renders him mute, he is guided by his sister Alune in her distant temple sanctuary from where she pushes an arsenal of moonstone weapons into his hands. For as long as the moon shines overhead, Aphelios will never be alone.\nAphelios and Alune were twins born to the Lunari during a lunar convergence; when the moon of the Spirit Realm eclipsed the physical moon. Because of the significance of their birth on a significant lunar event, the twins were celebrated as children of destiny. Growing up as loyal zealots of the Lunari faith, the two embraced the night and hid in the shadows, away from the oppressive Solari that ruled them as heretics.\nMirroring the two moons that marked their births, Aphelios trained tirelessly with mystical moonstone blades, becoming physically strong as a symbol of the physical moon. Throughout his rigorous training he only truly bonded with his twin sister Alune, who was gifted magically and trained to be a seer as a symbol of the spiritual moon, using her magic to reveal hidden paths and truths using the light of the moon.\nEventually, Alune's training would require her to leave the Lunari temple that the two had been raised in, causing Aphelios to separate from his sister more often. Saddened by his sister's increasing absence and desperate for purpose, Aphelios underwent a ceremonial journey in order to discover his pathway in life, or his orbit , as the Lunari call it. On his religious journey, Aphelios discovered a pool full of poisonous noctum flowers hidden in a cave. These rare flowers bloomed beneath the water's surface, allowing the poison to be distilled into a liquid that, if consumed, was thought to open one's mind to the power of the moon. Drinking the noctum's essence as part of his ceremonial journey, Aphelios felt a pain so intense that his entire body became numb, allowing Aphelios's body to be completely immune to pain. However, Aphelios's vocal cords would tighten up and render him almost completely mute while under the influence of the noctum essence.\nNot long after completing his journey, an ancient Lunari fortress called the Marus Omegnum began to phase in from the Spirit Realm; an event that hasn't occurred in centuries. Lunari from all over Targon gathered to the location of the ancient temple, hoping to witness the event as a sign of a new era for the Lunari and a shifting of power in the cosmos. Traditionally, the Marus Omegnum would open up to a magically gifted individual to occupy it every time it phased into existence, with this year's chosen occupant being Alune. Aphelios, to the Lunari's surprise, personally requested to witness the event and see his sister move on to the spiritual fortress.\nAphelios's ceremonial bracelet on a Lunari pedestal.\nAs the Marus Omegnum phased into reality under a veil of moonlight, the oppressive Solari discovered the gathered Lunari and initiated an ambush to purge them. Aphelios fought bravely to protect his people but got defeated, left with his moonstone blades shattered and reaching towards the noctum flower he retrieved from his journey. As Alune rushed into the temple, she reached the heart of the fortress while Aphelios consumed the noctum flower at the same time. As Alune's magical abilities were amplified within the spiritual fortress, Aphelios found he was capable of feeling his sister's powers embrace him, hearing her voice as she materialized a new moonstone weapon in his hand. Within the Marus Omegnum, Alune's powers would be magnified and allowed her to project her magic anywhere in the world as long as it found a focus-in this case being the noctum poison coursing through Aphelios's veins. Using her newly amplified powers, Alune pushed both herself and the temple back into the spirit realm while Aphelios fought off the Solari with a new arsenal of moonstone weapons .\nBy using the poisonous noctum, Aphelios found he could hollow himself out by numbing his body, becoming a living conduit for his sister's lunar magic. Alune on the other hand would remain alone within the spiritual fortress, guiding her brother from afar, seeing through his eyes and providing him with his mystical arsenal. Their souls were simultaneously close yet realms apart, converging into something they couldn't wholly understand. Now realizing their true destinies, the twins became the weapon that the Lunari needed; an agent to protect them in the newly shifting power balance of Targon between the Solari and Lunari.\nAphelios & Alune preparing to assassinate a 4 Solari Sunforger with Severum .\nIn order to protect the faithful Lunari from oppression, the twins would go on many missions together, combining their newfound abilities as Aphelios's assassin training was complimented by Alune's guidance and magical assistance. Over the course of their many missions, Alune would perfect the arsenal of weapons she provided her brother; each weapon being uniquely tied to a spiritual creature within the Marus Omegnum. [ 1 ] On most of their missions, Aphelios would be sent by his sister to assassinate many Solari targets that threatened their people. One of these targets would be a talented 4 Sunforger who enchanted Solari weapons with the power of the sun, who Aphelios would assassinate under the cover of night. [ 2 ]\nAphelios & Alune communing with one another while on a mission.\nWhile preparing in a cave temple for a mission, Aphelios felt his sister comforting him from the spirit realm, sharing his senses and sending him visions of both the past and of his next target: a mysterious barbarian from outside of Mount Targon. After drinking the poisonous noctum flower and numbing his body, he felt Alune's presence as she summoned Gravitum in his hands.\nAphelios then emerged from the cave and scaled the mountain, guided by his sister and armed with his new gravity cannon, he drew floating islands towards himself. After finally reaching his destination at the side of the mountain, Aphelios witnessed a group of Solari warriors infamously known as Burning Ones surrounding the same outsider he saw in his visions. After successfully killing the Solari with Severum and Crescendum , the barbarian outsider thanked Aphelios for saving him from the Solari warriors. Aphelios, though unwillingly, was forced to kill the man as part of his mission  to retrieve a mysterious scimitar stolen by the barbarian.\nAfter fully realizing what the weapon was, Alune stated that the scimitar's owner was fleeing from something-- though unsure of what. They knew that their next mission was to locate her and bring her back to the Lunari people. Aphelios, intent on completing his mission, walked into the night with the crescent blade in hand. [ 3 ]\nAphelios is a thin man with pale skin and dark hair. He wears elegant, sacred clothing with large shoulders and a deep collar with a distinctive palette of black, gray and turquoise. Hanging around his neck is a notable bright scarf made of a very silky, turquoise material etched with markings of the Lunari . The most distinctive ornament he has is the Targonian gold necklace with the symbol of the moon on it hanging below his neck. Aphelios's face has markings and makeup resembling more moon iconography that is common with the Lunari faith, most notably a circular marking across his whole face that correlates with the markings on his sister's face as well\nAphelios is an incredibly enigmatic person, but he is unwaveringly faithful to his people and protective of his only true bond; his twin sister. In the past, he was an extreme loner and rarely engaged in any social interactions or events with anyone other than his twin sister Alune . After being separated, Aphelios grew so sorrowful and purposeless that he embarked on a spiritual journey to find his own orbit in the universe, leading to the discovery of the noctum flowers .\nAfter becoming an honored agent for the Lunari , Aphelios remained extremely faithful and eternally loyal to not only his sister but to his Lunari faith as well, following its beliefs almost blindingly. Though he mourns the pain he endures and causes in his duties, he is comforted by his sister and reminded that everything he must do is in service to protecting his people from the oppressions of the Solari .\nAphelios and his twin sister were born within the Lunari faith during a rare convergence of the physical and spiritual moons, marking their births as significant and hailing them as children of destiny. Aphelios was a very devote follower to the Lunari, going through gruesome assassination training in his hope to protect them when threats against his people would arise. Despite this, he was infamously known for almost never socializing with anyone other than his sister.\nAfter the arrival of the Marus Omegnum , a major power shift from the heavens has begun to occur and caused an arising conflict between the Lunari and the rivaling Solari . Communing with his sister from the spirit realm and equipped with an arsenal of moonstone weapons, Aphelios now faithfully serves as the weapon to protect the Lunari, assassinating key targets and defending his people from dangers.\nAlune and Aphelios share a profound and intimate bond as twin siblings, born during the convergence of the physical and spiritual moons within the Lunari faith. Their connection is rooted in their birth's significance and their subsequent training in separate disciplines that symbolize these twin moons. While Aphelios specialized in the art of assassination, honing his skills in stealth and combat, Alune devoted herself to mastering her magical talents as a seer.\nDespite their divergent paths, Aphelios found solace and companionship almost exclusively in his twin sister. The depth of their relationship was such that when Alune's training required her to leave the temple and separate from her brother, Aphelios was left without a purpose, embarking on a spiritual journey to find his orbit, ultimately leading to his discovery of the noctum flowers.\nWhen the Marus Omegnum manifested in the physical realm for the first time in centuries, Alune was chosen to inhabit it. Aphelios, who rarely attended anything at all in his typical loneliness, personally requested to attend the event and witness his sister passing into the spirit realm. Once the Solari discovered the gathered Lunari and attacked, the twins were forced to act fast and combined their abilities together. Aphelios drank the essence of the poisonous noctum and willingly became a conduit for Alune's enhanced magic from within the Marus Omegnum. Since then, the two work in unison as faithful agents to the Lunari as Aphelios, utilizing his combat training, carries out physical missions, while Alune guides him and provides him with his diverse arsenal.\nAlthough the twins exist in separate realms, they can only truly come together when Aphelios consumes the poisonous noctum, rendering himself mute and numbing his senses. In this state, Alune can spiritually project herself to commune with her brother while they share each other's thoughts, feelings, and senses. However, the bittersweet consequence is that Alune can never physically be in Aphelios's presence and Aphelios is unable to verbally communicate with her due to being mute in the process. Their bond is a paradox of immense closeness and profound distance. They mourn the circumstances that necessitate their reunion, as Aphelios sacrifices his physicality to allow Alune to commune with him, while Alune grieves over the pain Aphelios endures on his missions, dedicating herself entirely to protecting him.\nThough Aphelios has never met Diana in person, she is the current Aspect of the Moon, serving as a physical embodiment of the deity that the Lunari pray to.\nCurrently, Alune has been granted visions that require her and Aphelios to seek out and locate Diana for an unknown reason. On their most recent mission, Aphelios managed to locate Diana's crescent blade, which had been left on the mountain and in the hands of a barbarian who Aphelios had to assassinate. The twins are aware that Diana is out there, running from something, but are attempting to figure out why and locate her.\nAs members of the Lunari, Aphelios and his sister are constantly persecuted by the Solari faith for heresy against their religion. The Solari serve as the main targets of Aphelios's mission to protect his people, having trained to assassinate and fight Solari that would threaten the Lunari even further.\nDuring the event of the Marus Omegnum's emergence in the physical realm, a group of Solari warriors discovered and attacked the gathered Lunari, ultimately leading to Alune and Aphelios combining their abilities to kill them.\nIn his most recent mission, Aphelios and Alune located a group of Solari warriors infamously called Burning Ones surrounding a key target of theirs; a barbarian holding the scimitar that formerly belonged to Diana.\nThough Aphelios never met Yuumi, Alune mentions that she is often visited by her from within the Marus Omegnum due to it being located within the spirit realm. Alune greatly appreciate's Yuumi's visits, as she often gets lonely without her brother, and sometimes mentions her when speaking to Aphelios."}

Traditionally, the Marus Omegnum would open up to a magically gifted individual to occupy it every time it phased into existence, with this year's chosen occupant being Alune. Aphelios, to the Lunari's surprise, personally requested to witness the event and see his sister move on to the spiritual fortress.\nAphelios's ceremonial bracelet on a Lunari pedestal.\nAs the Marus Omegnum phased into reality under a veil of moonlight, the oppressive Solari discovered the gathered Lunari and initiated an ambush to purge them. Aphelios fought bravely to protect his people but got defeated, left with his moonstone blades shattered and reaching towards the noctum flower he retrieved from his journey. As Alune rushed into the temple, she reached the heart of the fortress while Aphelios consumed the noctum flower at the same time. As Alune's magical abilities were amplified within the spiritual fortress, Aphelios found he was capable of feeling his sister's powers embrace him, hearing her voice as she materialized a new moonstone weapon in his hand. Within the Marus Omegnum, Alune's powers would be magnified and allowed her to project her magic anywhere in the world as long as it found a focus-in this case being the noctum poison coursing through Aphelios's veins. Using her newly amplified powers, Alune pushed both herself and the temple back into the spirit realm while Aphelios fought off the Solari with a new arsenal of moonstone weapons .\nBy using the poisonous noctum, Aphelios found he could hollow himself out by numbing his body, becoming a living conduit for his sister's lunar magic. Alune on the other hand would remain alone within the spiritual fortress, guiding her brother from afar, seeing through his eyes and providing him with his mystical arsenal. Their souls were simultaneously close yet realms apart, converging into something they couldn't wholly understand. Now realizing their true destinies, the twins became the weapon that the Lunari needed; an agent to protect them in the newly shifting power balance of Targon between the Solari and Lunari.\nAphelios & Alune preparing to assassinate a 4 Solari Sunforger with Severum .\nIn order to protect the faithful Lunari from oppression, the twins would go on many missions together, combining their newfound abilities as Aphelios's assassin training was complimented by Alune's guidance and magical assistance. Over the course of their many missions, Alune would perfect the arsenal of weapons she provided her brother; each weapon being uniquely tied to a spiritual creature within the Marus Omegnum. [ 1 ] On most of their missions, Aphelios would be sent by his sister to assassinate many Solari targets that threatened their people. One of these targets would be a talented 4 Sunforger who enchanted Solari weapons with the power of the sun, who Aphelios would assassinate under the cover of night. [ 2 ]\nAphelios & Alune communing with one another while on a mission.\nWhile preparing in a cave temple for a mission, Aphelios felt his sister comforting him from the spirit realm, sharing his senses and sending him visions of both the past and of his next target: a mysterious barbarian from outside of Mount Targon. After drinking the poisonous noctum flower and numbing his body, he felt Alune's presence as she summoned Gravitum in his hands.\nAphelios then emerged from the cave and scaled the mountain, guided by his sister and armed with his new gravity cannon, he drew floating islands towards himself. After finally reaching his destination at the side of the mountain, Aphelios witnessed a group of Solari warriors infamously known as Burning Ones surrounding the same outsider he saw in his visions. After successfully killing the Solari with Severum and Crescendum , the barbarian outsider thanked Aphelios for saving him from the Solari warriors. Aphelios, though unwillingly, was forced to kill the man as part of his mission  to retrieve a mysterious scimitar stolen by the barbarian.\nAfter fully realizing what the weapon was, Alune stated that the scimitar's owner was fleeing from something-- though unsure of what. They knew that their next mission was to locate her and bring her back to the Lunari people. Aphelios, intent on completing his mission, walked into the night with the crescent blade in hand. [ 3 ]\nAphelios is a thin man with pale skin and dark hair. He wears elegant, sacred clothing with large shoulders and a deep collar with a distinctive palette of black, gray and turquoise. Hanging around his neck is a notable bright scarf made of a very silky, turquoise material etched with markings of the Lunari . The most distinctive ornament he has is the Targonian gold necklace with the symbol of the moon on it hanging below his neck. Aphelios's face has markings and makeup resembling more moon iconography that is common with the Lunari faith, most notably a circular marking across his whole face that correlates with the markings on his sister's face as well\nAphelios is an incredibly enigmatic person, but he is unwaveringly faithful to his people and protective of his only true bond; his twin sister. In the past, he was an extreme loner and rarely engaged in any social interactions or events with anyone other than his twin sister Alune . After being separated, Aphelios grew so sorrowful and purposeless that he embarked on a spiritual journey to find his own orbit in the universe, leading to the discovery of the noctum flowers .\nAfter becoming an honored agent for the Lunari , Aphelios remained extremely faithful and eternally loyal to not only his sister but to his Lunari faith as well, following its beliefs almost blindingly. Though he mourns the pain he endures and causes in his duties, he is comforted by his sister and reminded that everything he must do is in service to protecting his people from the oppressions of the Solari .\nAphelios and his twin sister were born within the Lunari faith during a rare convergence of the physical and spiritual moons, marking their births as significant and hailing them as children of destiny. Aphelios was a very devote follower to the Lunari, going through gruesome assassination training in his hope to protect them when threats against his people would arise. Despite this, he was infamously known for almost never socializing with anyone other than his sister.\nAfter the arrival of the Marus Omegnum , a major power shift from the heavens has begun to occur and caused an arising conflict between the Lunari and the rivaling Solari . Communing with his sister from the spirit realm and equipped with an arsenal of moonstone weapons, Aphelios now faithfully serves as the weapon to protect the Lunari, assassinating key targets and defending his people from dangers.\nAlune and Aphelios share a profound and intimate bond as twin siblings, born during the convergence of the physical and spiritual moons within the Lunari faith. Their connection is rooted in their birth's significance and their subsequent training in separate disciplines that symbolize these twin moons. While Aphelios specialized in the art of assassination, honing his skills in stealth and combat, Alune devoted herself to mastering her magical talents as a seer.\nDespite their divergent paths, Aphelios found solace and companionship almost exclusively in his twin sister. The depth of their relationship was such that when Alune's training required her to leave the temple and separate from her brother, Aphelios was left without a purpose, embarking on a spiritual journey to find his orbit, ultimately leading to his discovery of the noctum flowers.\nWhen the Marus Omegnum manifested in the physical realm for the first time in centuries, Alune was chosen to inhabit it. Aphelios, who rarely attended anything at all in his typical loneliness, personally requested to attend the event and witness his sister passing into the spirit realm. Once the Solari discovered the gathered Lunari and attacked, the twins were forced to act fast and combined their abilities together. Aphelios drank the essence of the poisonous noctum and willingly became a conduit for Alune's enhanced magic from within the Marus Omegnum. Since then, the two work in unison as faithful agents to the Lunari as Aphelios, utilizing his combat training, carries out physical missions, while Alune guides him and provides him with his diverse arsenal.\nAlthough the twins exist in separate realms, they can only truly come together when Aphelios consumes the poisonous noctum, rendering himself mute and numbing his senses. In this state, Alune can spiritually project herself to commune with her brother while they share each other's thoughts, feelings, and senses. However, the bittersweet consequence is that Alune can never physically be in Aphelios's presence and Aphelios is unable to verbally communicate with her due to being mute in the process. Their bond is a paradox of immense closeness and profound distance. They mourn the circumstances that necessitate their reunion, as Aphelios sacrifices his physicality to allow Alune to commune with him, while Alune grieves over the pain Aphelios endures on his missions, dedicating herself entirely to protecting him.\nThough Aphelios has never met Diana in person, she is the current Aspect of the Moon, serving as a physical embodiment of the deity that the Lunari pray to.\nCurrently, Alune has been granted visions that require her and Aphelios to seek out and locate Diana for an unknown reason. On their most recent mission, Aphelios managed to locate Diana's crescent blade, which had been left on the mountain and in the hands of a barbarian who Aphelios had to assassinate. The twins are aware that Diana is out there, running from something, but are attempting to figure out why and locate her.\nAs members of the Lunari, Aphelios and his sister are constantly persecuted by the Solari faith for heresy against their religion. The Solari serve as the main targets of Aphelios's mission to protect his people, having trained to assassinate and fight Solari that would threaten the Lunari even further.\nDuring the event of the Marus Omegnum's emergence in the physical realm, a group of Solari warriors discovered and attacked the gathered Lunari, ultimately leading to Alune and Aphelios combining their abilities to kill them.\nIn his most recent mission, Aphelios and Alune located a group of Solari warriors infamously called Burning Ones surrounding a key target of theirs; a barbarian holding the scimitar that formerly belonged to Diana.\nThough Aphelios never met Yuumi, Alune mentions that she is often visited by her from within the Marus Omegnum due to it being located within the spirit realm. Alune greatly appreciate's Yuumi's visits, as she often gets lonely without her brother, and sometimes mentions her when speaking to Aphelios."}

Stoic, intelligent, and idealistic, yet uncomfortable with her role as leader, she taps into the ancestral magics of her lineage to wield a bow of True Ice. With her people's belief that she is the mythological hero Avarosa reincarnated, Ashe hopes to unify the Freljord once more by retaking their ancient, tribal lands.\nThe only child of Grena , the matriarchal chieftain of the tiny Avarosan tribe, Ashe is Iceborn : a member of the warrior caste, gifted with an ancestral connection to the magic of her lands, and the rare ability to wield the power of True Ice . Everyone assumed that Ashe would follow her mother as the tribe's next leader. However, this was never a glory Ashe desired. The grim responsibility of her warlike lineage and extraordinary gifts instead left Ashe feeling isolated, burdened, and alone.\nHer only respite was when Sejuani , an Iceborn girl from a sister tribe, would stay with them for the summer hunts around the Ornnkaal Rocks . The girls' friendship defined their childhoods, but was cut short just as they reached their teens. Somehow, Grena had offended Sejuani's grandmother, and the fellowship between their tribes ended suddenly.\nSoon after, with her youth fading, Ashe's mother began her lifelong quest for the “Throne of Avarosa”, a supposed hoard of treasures and magical items that she hoped would return her people to greatness.\nBut Grena’s belief in prophecies and legends led her to take risks, which often left her tribe enfeebled. Finally, during a dangerous and unnecessary raid in another tribe's lands, Grena was killed. Her sudden death left young Ashe on the run, while most of her tribe was wiped out.\nAlone, pursued, Ashe followed her mother's last map to a deserted glacier where she found the supposed grave of Avarosa, and her magical bow of True Ice. Ashe used the weapon to avenge her mother's death, then turned west.\nWhether it was out of duty or loneliness, Ashe gained a reputation by protecting the many scattered hearthbound tribes she encountered. She spurned the custom of taking thralls, and instead chose to adopt these desperate people as full members of her new tribe, and her fame grew quickly. Soon many began to believe that she did not just carry the weapon of Avarosa—Ashe was the legend herself, reborn and destined to reunite the Freljord.\nBut tall tales would not feed her followers, and their long march south left the tribe on the verge of starvation. So, Ashe leveraged the myths surrounding her, using them to form alliances with the powerful and land-rich southern tribes, promising to unite them into a nation capable of challenging neighboring kingdoms.\nThese new alliances brought new dangers, and Ashe quickly found herself at the center of a political feud. A Warmother, as Freljordian tribal leaders are known, was expected to wed, and taking a husband from one of the major tribes would anger the others. Ashe could take several husbands, but this would only bring the conflict to a boil within her own household, and the ensuing bloodshed would shatter the alliances she had fought to build.\nHer answer was an impoverished vagabond from a mountain clan that had been nearly wiped out—the warrior Tryndamere .

He fought with abandon, desperate to prove the destitute survivors of his clan were worthy of adoption by one of the stronger tribes. But even for the Freljord, his brutal fighting style and extraordinary vitality were unsettling, and many suspected he was touched by dark magic. Ignoring this, Ashe offered to adopt his people as her own, if he became her first and only bloodsworn.\nTryndamere accepted reluctantly. Though a political marriage, the attraction they felt for each other was palpable, and slowly a true affection blossomed.\nAshe is a slender, pale-skinned woman with blue eyes and long white hair.

She is idealistic as well, believing that by retaking their ancient, tribal lands once more will unite the Freljord.\nHowever, Ashe is implied to have a heated temper and vengeful streak, especially to those who have hurt her allies in the past. Her rage is so intense that she relies on the stinging cold of True Ice to keep her calm.\nAshe and Sejuani were childhood friends but were separated when Ashe's mother offended Sejuani's grandmother about how she was raising Sejuani. They were eventually reunited as teenagers after Ashe's tribe was decimated by Lissandra's frost priests, but the two had a falling out during a raid against a neighbor of the Winter's Claw. These neighbors, whom Ashe did not want to kill, would later become the first members of the new Avarosans.

His awesome power was channeled into immortal god-warriors to protect the apparently insignificant world of Runeterra—now, desiring a return to his mastery of the cosmos, Aurelion Sol will 15 drag the very stars from the sky , if he must, in order to regain his freedom.\nBorn at the beginning of creation, Aurelion Sol and his kin were alive for eons before Runeterra even existed. They wandered through the early universe, seeking to fill it with wonders. Aurelion Sol's passion was creating stars; he forged systems and galaxies as he traveled. He rarely met any equals in power and stayed away from the Aspects, who were egotistical and uninterested in creation, instead focusing on their own philosophies.\nWhen Aurelion Sol returned to one of his earliest creations, he was surprised to see that there was a world orbiting it, a planet he had not formed. The Aspects seemed invested in this world, Runeterra, where crude civilizations had sprung up. They urged him to come closer and guide the inhabitants. Flattered by the opportunity to have his glory praised, Aurelion Sol descended upon Mount Targon, taking the form of a cosmic dragon. The Targonians named him Sol, after their sun, and the Aspects demanded they make him a gift to thank him for it. This came in the form of a golden crown, which they offered to him.\nAs soon as it touched him, though, it became clear that this was no gift. The crown attached to its head, etched with magic so powerful that even he could not remove it. It restricted his powers and placed him firmly in the control of the Aspects. Aurelion Sol realized what was happening, but before he could retaliate, he was thrown back into space and prevented from coming near Runeterra. With Aurelion Sol at their command, the Aspects channeled his powers into a massive Sun Disc that the mortals had made. Using his energy, they raised up mortals into god-warriors, and when the first Sun Disc fell, a more powerful one took its place. Aurelion Sol was forced to watch as these Ascended destroyed first their enemies, then Void-creatures, and finally themselves.\nThe stars he had created began to fade because of neglect, but he was still unable to free himself and help them. The Aspects ferried him between different planets to complete tasks for them, not realizing that the crown's bonds were slowly weakening. Aurelion Sol decided that when he escaped, he would take revenge on the Aspects and destroy Runeterra for detaining him, and finally got the chance when a series of magical cataclysms rendered the planet almost defenceless.\nAurelion Sol was called back to Runeterra by a previous incarnation of Pantheon , the Aspect of War. As always, he appeared in the sky as a glowing comet, invoking various reactions and emotions from the people below. As he witnessed the people react to him in ways he had seen before, Aurelion Sol thought about how humans never learned from their mistakes and how circular the pattern of history is. He scoffed at the primitive nature of the people below, hearing their names for him, and deeming them all incorrect, believing that these lowly creatures could never understand what he truly was.\nWhen he arrived on the mountain on which Pantheon was waiting for him, the Aspect ordered him to seal a breach into The Void that had formed in the mountain. However, Aurelion Sol did not immediately obey, managing to unease the Aspect. Eventually, he was forced to obey the Pantheon, and he destroyed some of the the various energies and Voidborn creatures that emerged from the rift. However, he was not able to seal the rift, as there was a sentient being keeping it open. Aurelion Sol felt the energy eminating from the rift and realized that this being was laughing at him.\nInfuriated, Aurelion Sol formed three fledgling stars out of the elements around him and threw all three at the rift. The stars seared the abyss closed, with an explosion so massive that it that it destroyed the mountain that the rift had formed on and everything on it, along with Pantheon's physical form. Across Runeterra, mortals saw what many called a 'second dawn', caused by the light that was released by the explosion.\nAurelion Sol had killed Pantheon's physical form, he had disobeyed orders from the Aspects themselves, and the cost of such insubordination was the life of a star, which physically and emotionally hurt him. His fury that a sun was the cost of an Aspect's physical form was tempered by the knowledge that he had learned from the Aspects' mistakes once again. From across the universe, the Aspects rushed to direct him somewhere else. As he left Runeterra, Aurelion Sol sensed that a new host - possibly Atreus - was chosen to bear the spirit of Pantheon. As he took pleasure in the confusion and desperation he sensed from the Aspects, Aurelion Sol left Runeterra, knowing that the Aspects were afraid of what he might do next.\nFear.\"\nAurelion Sol has been called back to Runeterra, though it is unclear for what purpose. Moreover, he has summoned 6 Inviolus Vox to the planet, to await the time when dragons across the universe shall descend upon Runeterra.\nWhile most cannot see or even comprehend his true form, Aurelion Sol takes the form of a cosmic dragon when not in the celestial realm . In this form, he is larger than even Mount Targon, Runeterra's tallest mountain. His skin is dark blue, resembling the color of deep space, and glistens with the light of stars. He glows in this form in light and dark shades of blue, and his head is white with sharp spikes resembling teeth around his mouth. What could be considered his hair is a deep purple and dark blue, and attached to his head is a golden crown.\nAurelion Sol is an arrogant and prideful celestial being. He is angry at the Aspects for imprisoning him and is determined to destroy Runeterra. He is impatient and irritable and is extremely dismissive of Aspects (apart from Zoe ) and anybody that he sees as inferior to him. Made bitter by his imprisonment, perhaps the only things that Aurelion Sol cares about are the stars he has created.\nAurelion Sol has several 'siblings' in the sense that they are celestial dragons like him, including 6 Inviolus Vox and 8 The Infinite Mindsplitter . 8 The Immortal Fire may also be a sibling.\nHe has also created several constellations, including 1 The Charger , 3 The Trickster , 2 The Messenger , 10 The Scourge , 0 The Serpent , and 9 The Great Beyond . The Great Beyond is what Aurelion Sol considers his magnum opus, and he would like it to be the first to attack Mount Targon.\nHe is fully aware of the existence of other celestial entities such as Bard and Soraka .\nAurelion Sol hates the people of Targon and the Aspects, as they are the ones who enslaved him.\nAurelion Sol has disdain for both the Solari and Lunari, and by extension Leona and Diana. This is because he sees their divisions as pointless, since moonlight is merely reflected sunlight.\nAurelion Sol and Zoe are well-acquainted. She is the only Targonian Aspect that appears to offer him aid and protection from the Aspects' wrath.

Determined to learn more about the spirit realm's inhabitants, she left her home to further her research and happened upon a wayward demigod who’d become twisted and lost to time. Witnessing his desperation, Aurora resolved to find a way to help her feral friend regain his forgotten identity—a journey that would take her to the farthest reaches of the Freljord.\nAurora was born in the secluded village of Aamu as a member of a vastayan tribe known as the Bryni, a secluded tribe of rabbit-like vastaya that remained isolated from other vastayan tribes, causing their inherent magic to be more diluted. [ 1 ] Aurora was born with the innate ability to interact much more closely with the Spirit Realm , making many 'friends' that only she could see. Aurora's parents believed this to just be her wild imagination, but Aurora's great aunt Havu actually encouraged her unique abilities and passions, allowing her to revel in her own company.\nAs Aurora grew up, she started to understand her ability more, realizing these imaginary friends were actually spirits and that she had a special ability to peer through the veil between the mortal and spiritual realms. Using this special unique sight, Aurora meticulously documented and studied these spirits to help others understand the world as she saw it.\nWhile more and more spirits appeared before Aurora during her studies, she began to discover some that felt lost between the realms, disturbed by mortal affairs. Seeking to help these spirits return to the spirit realm, she continued her research outside of Aamu and began to travel further out of the Freljord , nervously leaving her home behind to expand her knowledge on spirits and how to help them.\nDuring her travels, Aurora encountered a particularly monstrous spirit in the shape of a twisted elk. The spirit was feral and afraid, lashing out with bloodstained antlers while Aurora tried to calm him down.

Determined to learn more about the spirit realm's inhabitants, she left her home to further her research and happened upon a wayward demigod who’d become twisted and lost to time. Witnessing his desperation, Aurora resolved to find a way to help her feral friend regain his forgotten identity—a journey that would take her to the farthest reaches of the Freljord.\nAurora was born in the secluded village of Aamu as a member of a vastayan tribe known as the Bryni, a secluded tribe of rabbit-like vastaya that remained isolated from other vastayan tribes, causing their inherent magic to be more diluted. [ 1 ] Aurora was born with the innate ability to interact much more closely with the Spirit Realm , making many 'friends' that only she could see. Aurora's parents believed this to just be her wild imagination, but Aurora's great aunt Havu actually encouraged her unique abilities and passions, allowing her to revel in her own company.\nAs Aurora grew up, she started to understand her ability more, realizing these imaginary friends were actually spirits and that she had a special ability to peer through the veil between the mortal and spiritual realms. Using this special unique sight, Aurora meticulously documented and studied these spirits to help others understand the world as she saw it.\nWhile more and more spirits appeared before Aurora during her studies, she began to discover some that felt lost between the realms, disturbed by mortal affairs. Seeking to help these spirits return to the spirit realm, she continued her research outside of Aamu and began to travel further out of the Freljord , nervously leaving her home behind to expand her knowledge on spirits and how to help them.\nDuring her travels, Aurora encountered a particularly monstrous spirit in the shape of a twisted elk. The spirit was feral and afraid, lashing out with bloodstained antlers while Aurora tried to calm him down. She eventually managed to gain his trust, but her attempts to heal and help him would only end in failure. Still determined to help the elk spirit, Aurora convinced him to travel with her and used her powers to tuck him away in the spirit realm while she worked to unravel what was afflicting the elk spirit.\nAfter encountering a number of powerful spirit walkers; shamans capable of communing with the spiritual demigods of the Freljord, they were simply at a loss at how to help the elk spirit and suggested that she sought out Udyr , the Freljord's most powerful spirit walker.

His hubris saw him betrayed and murdered at the moment of his greatest triumph, but now, millennia later, he has been reborn as an Ascended being of immense power. With his buried city risen from the sand, Azir seeks to restore Shurima to its former glory.\nAzir was the last son of the emperor of Shurima. He never received the same love from the emperor as did the other children. It was highly unexpected that he would be the one to become emperor. He spent most of his time studying the texts rather than training for combat.\nAzir met a slave looking for texts for his master in the library. Surprisingly, he was able to help Azir understand complex grammar from an ancient text. The two quickly became friends after this, and Azir named the boy Xerath, even though slaves were not allowed names.\nOne day, while the royal family was travelling in the desert, they were attacked by assassins. Azir and Xerath had gone out to plot the stars. Xerath managed to suppress the attacker while Azir plunged a dagger into his throat. But Azir’s brothers had all been killed before Renekton managed to slay the assassins. Azir promised that one day, he and Xerath would be brothers.\nAzir, now heir to the throne, began to train in combat under the tutelage of Renekton. He learned to wield the sword and spear.\nStrangely, all the sons of the emperor’s wife began to die before they were born. Then one was finally born. But during a great storm, the emperor’s wife was killed along with her newborn son. It was said that the emperor went mad with grief and took his own life, leaving Azir to take the throne.\nXerath had secretly longed for the power of ascension himself and saw Azir as a threat to his own aspirations; a world without slavery, and to end that, he secretly planned to guide Azir to the Dais of Ascension himself. On the day of Ascension, just as Azir is ascended-Xerath used his magic to subvert the ritual, causing it to fail and unleashing a catastrophic explosion that destroyed the capital city of Shurima, killing many of Azir's people in the process.\nIn the aftermath of the failed ascension, Azir was presumed dead, and Shurima fell into ruin and decay. However, Azir had actually ascended in a flawed and incomplete manner, becoming trapped in a state of suspended animation, his body and spirit separated from each other. Over the centuries, Azir's spirit remained dormant, while his body was preserved in a state of stasis within a chamber in The Sun Disc, an ancient structure that had been built to harness the power of the sun and the magic of the Ascended. It wasn't until the present day, when The Sun Disc was rediscovered and reactivated, that Azir's body was reawakened, and his spirit was reunited with it. When the tomb containing the Sun Disc and Azir was opened, chaos broke out and Sivir 's blood spilled over to the sand, awakening the falcon god in the process.\nAs Azir awakened, he was confronted by the brutal reality of his empire's decline and the treachery of those who had sought to undermine him, especially the now berserk Xerath . Despite these obstacles, Azir remained determined to reclaim his throne and rebuild Shurima, using his newfound power and knowledge to unite his people and restore their former glory.\nAzir is a tall male humanoid figure with features of a bird, specifically a falcon, his head is that of a golden falcon with blue eyes that shine like sapphires.He wears ancient golden Shuriman armor with red ribbons hanging from his arms and a white cape on his back.\nWhen he was human, Azir was a brown-skinned man and quite stocky, with long dark hair tied in dreadlocks and various trappings of royalty.He didn't wear a shirt but his chest and arms were adorned with all kinds of Shuriman amulets and necklaces, he wore white baggy pants with red ribbons around his hips.\nAzir is a proud, determined ruler who sees potential in others. While he originally had no chance of being emperor, he befriended Xerath and saw him more than just a mere slave, but also a friend and even a brother. He wished to repay Xerath by giving him rewards and a higher status, but the societal values of Shurima prevented this. Despite this, Azir wished to become emperor to abolish slavery and give Xerath what he would've wanted, but his power led to him becoming hubristic, which was Azir's biggest weakness and one of the causes of Shurima's downfall. While he did have selfless intentions for the empire, his arrogance prevented him from communicating his goals with Xerath and seeing when he was being manipulated, and his shortsightedness towards the consequences of his actions caused Xerath's resentment to grow to the point where by the time he announced his plan, it was too late and Xerath had already made his decision to betray him.\nSince his resurrection, Azir now wishes to rebuild the empire and return Shurima to its former glory is a very noble gesture, calling upon the help of his allies in order to do so.\nHowever Azir has shown a quite noble and generous side, since one of the things he always wanted to do after becoming emperor was to abolish slavery and help the poor, he has shown a kinder side of him when he saved Sivir's life.\nXerath's treachery made Azir furious at his former soul brother betraying his trust to become an Ascended being and destroying Shurima in the process. He can't let go because he truly loved his nation, however much his ambition may have led him astray. He can't accept responsibility for what happened to his kingdom - he blames Xerath, but was it really Xerath's fault...? Or was it the emperor who couldn't see the cruel intent of his most trusted advisor - and friend? And yes - for the moment, he is an emperor without an empire. An emperor without a people. He has nothing - but he'll do everything with his newfound power to change that, and rebuild Shurima into the thriving, powerful empire it once was.\nGiven Ezreal's exploration of the Shurima Desert and robbing of artifacts from its tombs, it's likely Azir won't be entirely fond of him.\nAzir dislikes Sivir's graverobbing but does not resent her. She is family after all, and saving her from Cassiopeia's backstabbing meant everything at the time of his revival. He would hold his hatred for Cassiopeia for almost ending his bloodline forever.\nWhen he was young, Azir was taught ancient knowledge from Nasus and combat from Renekton . The Ascended brothers' teachings will prove useful for the trials ahead.\nAzir is disappointed that a mighty warrior such as Renekton has been reduced to a rabid beast after being tortured beyond insanity for imprisoning himself with Xerath.\nOn the other hand, Nasus might be the only remaining Ascended that can help the Emperor. Azir deeply respects Nasus, though the Curator looks down on him for his arrogance and for what his hubris did to Shurima. [ 1 ]"}

But during a great storm, the emperor’s wife was killed along with her newborn son. It was said that the emperor went mad with grief and took his own life, leaving Azir to take the throne.\nXerath had secretly longed for the power of ascension himself and saw Azir as a threat to his own aspirations; a world without slavery, and to end that, he secretly planned to guide Azir to the Dais of Ascension himself. On the day of Ascension, just as Azir is ascended-Xerath used his magic to subvert the ritual, causing it to fail and unleashing a catastrophic explosion that destroyed the capital city of Shurima, killing many of Azir's people in the process.\nIn the aftermath of the failed ascension, Azir was presumed dead, and Shurima fell into ruin and decay. However, Azir had actually ascended in a flawed and incomplete manner, becoming trapped in a state of suspended animation, his body and spirit separated from each other. Over the centuries, Azir's spirit remained dormant, while his body was preserved in a state of stasis within a chamber in The Sun Disc, an ancient structure that had been built to harness the power of the sun and the magic of the Ascended. It wasn't until the present day, when The Sun Disc was rediscovered and reactivated, that Azir's body was reawakened, and his spirit was reunited with it. When the tomb containing the Sun Disc and Azir was opened, chaos broke out and Sivir 's blood spilled over to the sand, awakening the falcon god in the process.\nAs Azir awakened, he was confronted by the brutal reality of his empire's decline and the treachery of those who had sought to undermine him, especially the now berserk Xerath . Despite these obstacles, Azir remained determined to reclaim his throne and rebuild Shurima, using his newfound power and knowledge to unite his people and restore their former glory.\nAzir is a tall male humanoid figure with features of a bird, specifically a falcon, his head is that of a golden falcon with blue eyes that shine like sapphires.He wears ancient golden Shuriman armor with red ribbons hanging from his arms and a white cape on his back.\nWhen he was human, Azir was a brown-skinned man and quite stocky, with long dark hair tied in dreadlocks and various trappings of royalty.He didn't wear a shirt but his chest and arms were adorned with all kinds of Shuriman amulets and necklaces, he wore white baggy pants with red ribbons around his hips.\nAzir is a proud, determined ruler who sees potential in others. While he originally had no chance of being emperor, he befriended Xerath and saw him more than just a mere slave, but also a friend and even a brother. He wished to repay Xerath by giving him rewards and a higher status, but the societal values of Shurima prevented this. Despite this, Azir wished to become emperor to abolish slavery and give Xerath what he would've wanted, but his power led to him becoming hubristic, which was Azir's biggest weakness and one of the causes of Shurima's downfall. While he did have selfless intentions for the empire, his arrogance prevented him from communicating his goals with Xerath and seeing when he was being manipulated, and his shortsightedness towards the consequences of his actions caused Xerath's resentment to grow to the point where by the time he announced his plan, it was too late and Xerath had already made his decision to betray him.\nSince his resurrection, Azir now wishes to rebuild the empire and return Shurima to its former glory is a very noble gesture, calling upon the help of his allies in order to do so.\nHowever Azir has shown a quite noble and generous side, since one of the things he always wanted to do after becoming emperor was to abolish slavery and help the poor, he has shown a kinder side of him when he saved Sivir's life.\nXerath's treachery made Azir furious at his former soul brother betraying his trust to become an Ascended being and destroying Shurima in the process. He can't let go because he truly loved his nation, however much his ambition may have led him astray. He can't accept responsibility for what happened to his kingdom - he blames Xerath, but was it really Xerath's fault...? Or was it the emperor who couldn't see the cruel intent of his most trusted advisor - and friend? And yes - for the moment, he is an emperor without an empire. An emperor without a people. He has nothing - but he'll do everything with his newfound power to change that, and rebuild Shurima into the thriving, powerful empire it once was.\nGiven Ezreal's exploration of the Shurima Desert and robbing of artifacts from its tombs, it's likely Azir won't be entirely fond of him.\nAzir dislikes Sivir's graverobbing but does not resent her. She is family after all, and saving her from Cassiopeia's backstabbing meant everything at the time of his revival. He would hold his hatred for Cassiopeia for almost ending his bloodline forever.\nWhen he was young, Azir was taught ancient knowledge from Nasus and combat from Renekton . The Ascended brothers' teachings will prove useful for the trials ahead.\nAzir is disappointed that a mighty warrior such as Renekton has been reduced to a rabid beast after being tortured beyond insanity for imprisoning himself with Xerath.\nOn the other hand, Nasus might be the only remaining Ascended that can help the Emperor. Azir deeply respects Nasus, though the Curator looks down on him for his arrogance and for what his hubris did to Shurima. [ 1 ]"}

Many Runeterrans sing songs that ponder his extraordinary nature, yet they all agree that the cosmic vagabond is drawn to artifacts of great magical power. Surrounded by a jubilant choir of helpful meeps , it is impossible to mistake his actions as malevolent, as Bard always serves the greater good... in his own odd way.\nBard is a Celestial who existed at the Creation of the Universe within the Celestial Realm . Initially drifting aimlessly, Bard found a new purpose when the Celestial Dragon Aurelion Sol forged the universe's first stars, producing a symphony of creation. Bard traversed the celestial harmonies of the universe and began to attract new companions called meeps ; celestial spirit creatures spawned from the residual inspiration used to create the stars.\nAs Bard continued his travel, the meeps alerted him to a world with a unique song of its own called Runeterra , a realm filled with primitive and chaotic music that disharmonized with the rest of the cosmos. While he appreciated its inherent beauty, he realized that this song had become destructive and needed intervention before it can threaten the fabric of the universe.\nVenturing into the planet's physical realm, Bard first touched down on the continent of Ionia and created a physical form from the trinkets and fabrics of a shawm-player's wagon. He roamed Runeterra for an extensive period, confusing and bewildering any who would those he encountered. On his travels, Bard discovered that many powerful and unpredictable objects, such as the World Runes , had mysteriously been left scattered on the planet's surface by some unknown entities, which threatened to disrupt the balance of the universe.\nAs a caretaker, Bard personally took the task of retrieving these misplaced objects and restoring cosmic harmony in an effort to protect Runeterra from the forces that lay beyond . Seeing into the future, Bard saw an impending cataclysm that would span across all realms, anticipating for when he must choose a side to maintain the cosmic balance.\nIn the midst of the vicious Noxian Invasion of Ionia , a group of villagers settled around a mountain with a sacred temple at the very top of it. The Noxians eventually discovered the village and, in their conquest to take over the continent, sought out an immensely powerful, egg-like artifact of celestial origin in the mountain. The Noxians slaughtered most of these Ionians and ransacked the village in search of this artifact. Meanwhile, the village sage used the powerful artifact to obliterate a group of these soldiers, causing collateral damage to the surrounding area and slicing an entire mountain in half. Bard's instantly turned his attention to the shockwave made by the artifact as he rushed to the site of the invasion.\nFlying through the clashing Ionian and Noxian armies, Bard quickly flew up the mountain's steps and grabbed the artifact, taking it to the peak and placing it on a sacred pedestal. From there, Bard blew into his cosmic instrument, summoning a chorus of meeps to witness him as he used his powers to transport both himself and the artifact into the celestial realm away from the hands of mortals who could potentially weaponize it. Those witnessing the event saw Bard's transportation manifest into a three-pointed constellation in the sky, naming the mountain Bard Mountain in his honor. [ 1 ]\nWhile on his quest to preserve powerful artifacts, Bard would encounter many people who witnessed his mysterious deeds. Some artists and performers considered him a source of immense inspiration for great works of art, while others would be bewildered and confused by his bizarre nature.\nAccording to a travelling balladeer from the Freljord who made a stop in Demacia , his mother had an ancient chime that managed to attract a stray meep shortly before floating away. After chasing the flying chime, Bard himself appeared and placed the man in a dream-like state, temporarily transforming him into a meep and allowing him to perceive the universe as Bard does temporarily. In this form, he realized the coming dangers that Bard is attempting to avoid before returning to his mortal body. [ 2 ]\nA man named Old Gaff claimed that he saw Bard in the sky once, flying across the heavens like a falling star. [ 3 ] The day after, while sweeping the floors at his house, Old Gaff witnessed a similar entity to Bard named 1 Byrd , who created a physical form from his pots and pans before waddling away to a nearby temple as if it were looking for something. [ 4 ] At the temple, Old Gaff found Bard summoning a massive vortex of meeps, all singing and dancing in a beautiful choir as they rose upward before disappearing in a flash of light, leaving only a single chime in Old Gaff's hands. [ 5 ]\nBard continues his journey to protect the beauty of Runeterra by restoring its cosmic equilibrium, safeguarding immensely powerful artifacts that could potentially be misused by mortals in the future.\nMost recently on his travels, Bard has taken notice of Xolaani , a Darkin who has just recently possessed a brand new 3 host . [ 6 ] However, it's unclear what her significance to Bard is as he hasn't been shown to intervene.\nAt least fifty years in the future, one of the survivors of the Noxian invasion at Bard Mountain lives to become an elderly story teller, remaining on that very same mountain. Here, the storyteller would tell three teenagers various stories and describe the many constellations in the skies that represent significant events of the past; arrival of the Watchers in the Freljord , the fall of Shurima and the ruination of the Shadow Isles . The final constellation he talks about is the three pointed mask of Bard himself, which he witnessed on that very same mountain many years ago as a child. [ 7 ]\nBard is an ethereal Celestial being who created a corporeal form in order to traverse and interact with the physical world. [ 8 ] His corporeal form has stitched body with wooden-peg legs and a mask-face. Bard's true form is able to abandon his body while it 'deflates'.\nUnlike other Celestials that care for and meddle with the existence of mortal beings, Bard focuses more on the 'bigger picture,' interested more in the cosmic balance of Runeterra and assessing any threats that can endanger the fabric of all reality. The only time Bard notices or wholly interacts with a mortal being is if they are involved with some significant event or power that threatens the cosmic balance. Bard simply doesn't care for individual lives and instead is more concerned with the 'bigger picture' and seeing preserving life as a whole.\nBard would never intervene in combat with someone unless they themselves have some significance that could potentially alter the world's cosmic balance, almost completely ignoring anybody and everything that isn't his concern. Though Bard has the absolute best intentions in mind, he can come off as incredibly strange and whimsical in his behaviors, popping in and out of existence without warning almost mischievously.\nBard knows about and has met many Celestials on his travels around the cosmos. Unlike other Celestials however, Bard perceives the world in a completely unique way; as harmonious music rather than through sight. Along with that, Bard doesn't manifest in the physical realm through possessing a mortal body like the Aspects do, Bard instead possesses a collection of trinkets and instruments strewn together into a suitable form. Bard is aware of other Celestials and their affairs in meddling with Runeterra , such as how they had left behind countless powerful artifacts on the planet, but he simply questions why they would leave these objects behind and endanger the universe.\nAt the first breath of creation , Bard simply drifted across the cosmos without purpose or perception. It wasn't until Aurelion Sol forged the first stars that Bard began to perceive the universe as music, flowing across the harmonies between the stars and witnessing the beauty of the universe.\nBard perceives the universe as musical melodies and first took notice to Runeterra because of its inherent dissonance in the universe's harmonies. Though the music of Runeterra is primitive and chaotic it is also beautiful in its freedom, something that specifically took Bard's interest. However, he also sees the danger of this as Runeterra has the capability of growing so chaotic and destructive that it could end the stability of the cosmos, dedicating himself to becoming the cosmic caretaker of this world and keeping incomprehensible powers out of mortal hands.\nEver since touching down at Ionia , Bard continues to passively restore the balance of powers in Runeterra rather than interfering in major historical events, having no direct ties to major events such as the arrival of the Watchers , the Fall of Shurima or the Ruination of Helia . Though these events involved powerful forces, they had no major cosmic ramifications and thus didn't take Bard's notice. [ 10 ]\nThough its unknown whether or not the two have actually met in the past, it is very likely considering Ryze's age and their conjoined efforts in safeguarding powerful magics such as the World Runes ."}

Driven by epochs of repurposed history, knowledge, and memories from the world above, she voraciously feeds an ever-expanding need for new experiences and emotions, consuming all that crosses her path. Yet her wants could never be sated by only one world as she turns her hungry eyes toward the Void's old masters...\nThe Void was once an empty nothingness but upon the birth of a new dimension , the Void's silence was interrupted and new entities were forcefully pulled into reality, leading to the creation of the first Voidborn . These Voidborn were the subjects of the Watchers and held an innate desire to consume all of reality in order to return to the perfect silence of the Old Void.\nThe Lavender Sea .\nDue to the war efforts of mortals and the Watchers' attempted invasion of the Freljord , more rifts between the dimensions would rip open and increase the abrasive contact between both realities. The Void, mutating from constant contact with the Runeterran reality, would develop an 'allergic reaction' that took the form of a cancerous pocket of reality located underneath the deserts of Shurima called the Lavender Sea . Littered with hideously remade shapes and forms meant to mimic the world above, this pocket would mutate so heavily that it practically became sentient, managing to deny the commands of the Watchers and embrace its own desires, wishing to consume and remake all of existence in its own image rather than destroy it.\nMalzahar gathering a crowd of people to sacrifice to the Lavender Sea, as an ominous vision of Bel'Veth is seen behind him.\nAfter consuming more sentient beings, the Lavender Sea took inspiration from those it consumed and began to crave a leader to represent itself; something that could physically interact with the mortals of this reality. The Lavender Sea soon made contact with a Shuriman boy named Malzahar , delcaring him the prophet of the Void and granting him visions of an empress to feed mortal minds and memories to. [ 1 ] After opening up a large rift, Malzahar managed to sink the entire Shuriman port city of Belveth into the Void, allowing the Lavender Sea to completely consume and assimilate the city and some of the surrounding ocean. [ 2 ]\nBy consuming the collective consciousnesses of the entire city, Bel'Veth was finally born as a physical manifestation of the Lavender Sea.  Naming herself after the city she consumed at her birth, Bel'Veth was born from the combined memories, experiences and emotions of everyone that lived in the city when it sank, granting her millions of years worth of knowledge and near-omniscience. Still hungering to consume and remake all of reality, she then devised and perfected a plan to consume both Runeterra as well as ultimately stop her progenitors the Watchers.\nFrom within the Lavender Sea, Bel'Veth continues to enact her intricate plan, telapathically communicating with many mortal minds in the world above, most notably her prophet Malzahar, as well as other Voidborn that she urges to join her on her mission as she did with Vel'Koz .\nBel'Veth also sent out many Voidborn remora, drone-like creatures spawned from the Lavender Sea and shaped after the sealife that surrounded the city of Bel'Veth. Living as extensions of Bel'Veth's will, they were often sent out as swarms, overwhelming enemies to further Bel'Veth's plans. At some point a group of specialized remora, later nicknamed Lamplights , fought the Void huntress Kai'Sa while travelling through an underground passage in the Shuriman desert. These Lamplights soon fled to the Sai Kahleek and made contact with a colony of Xer'Sai , granting the hatchlings and Callers a peculiar, soft-blue glow and seemingly mutating them to follow Bel'Veth's commands. Angered by the intruders on their territory, a furious Dunebreaker attacked and killed the Lamplights alongside Kai'Sa and Taliyah . [ 3 ]\nBel'Veth confronting and showing her true form to Kai'Sa .\nAfter her fight against the Xer'Sai queen Rek'Sai , [ 4 ] Kai'Sa fell through a massive hole underground and landed inside the Lavender Sea itself, which Bel'Veth anticipated thanks to her careful planning. Bel'Veth revealed herself in a vaguely disguised form to Kai'Sa, who attempted to attack her in response before becoming restrained as Bel'Veth slowly shifted into her true, monstrous form. [ 5 ] Trapped and cornered, Kai'Sa began to realize that this creature was the embodiment of the entire city as Bel'Veth formally introduces herself and reveals that she named herself after the city she consumed, something that Kai'Sa thought was impossible for Voidborn to be capable of.\nNow slightly frightened by the alarmingly intelligent Voidborn, Kai'Sa exclaimed that she will kill Bel'Veth by any means, to which Bel'Veth simply states that she won't. Seeing herself as truly inevitable, Bel'Veth explained that she's already calculated and formed a perfectly intricate plan to consume all of reality and that others, such as her thought deceased Kassadin , have attempted to stop her already with little to no success. Shocked by the revelation about her father, Kai'Sa accused Bel'Veth of lying despite Bel'Veth stating that she simply doesn't see the use in lying.\nBy explaining her plan to eventually stop the Watchers from completely destroying reality, Bel'Veth began to bargain and offered Kai'Sa a choice: help her find a way to completely defeat her Watcher progenitors and in return Bel'Veth will spare humanity for a period of time, or resist and simply be destroyed with the rest of existence either by Bel'Veth or the Watchers.\nBel'Veth explains that though her victory is inevitable, she is willing to give mortals a chance to fight against her by sparing their lives for a short period of time, even though she's confident that they won't succeed. Furious by the prospect of working with this Void monster, Kai'Sa attempted to attack Bel'Veth once again with no effect, as she stabbed her in the chest with the tip of her wings and lifted her up. Bel'Veth told Kai'Sa to seek out the Watchers and find a way to destroy them before sending her flying upwards towards the surface, emerging out of the sands and left with Bel'Veth's proposition. [ 6 ]\nTypically, Bel'Veth utilizes a disguise with the face of a middle-aged woman with gray skin, deep purple eyes and a third eye in the center on her forehead. Draped on the side of her head is a dorsal fin-like structure mimicking a strand of hair. Her face isn't very animated, almost like a statue, and her mouth doesn't match her speech. Her shoulders have large spikes acting as shoulder pads and she wraps herself in her wings to mimic the appearance of a regal cloak, standing ten feet tall with a twenty-two foot wingspan. She has a tail that drags behind her with a massive bulb at the end.\nBel'Veth's true form is that of a golden stingray-like Voidborn , growing into a gargantuan size and revealing her 'face' to be a false head attached to a lure-like appendage. Her true face is revealed to be located at the center of her body where he chest would be; a massive gaping maw with teeth and four beady purple eyes. The protrusions on her shoulders are revealed to actually be horns on and her wings completely unfurl and appear as massive pectoral fins with pointed stingers at each tip.\nUnlike most Voidborn , Bel'Veth is sapient and individualistic due to the human qualities she consumed at her birth. Seeing herself as the embodiment of the true Void , her main goal is to assimilate all of Runeterra into the Lavender Sea and remake all of reality in her own perfected image. She is cold and immensely intelligent, having nigh-omniscience and the ability to calculate information at a humanely unfathomable rate. Because of this she is extremely arrogant, having calculated her plans so precisely that she genuinely sees her own success as an inevitability, though it's unclear whether or not this is genuine intelligence or just delusions of grandeur. Because of her arrogance, Bel'Veth sees herself as a superior being and looks down on most beings including her creators the Watchers . She is so certain of her success that she never lies, deciding only to state harsh truths as she sees it. In her efforts to eventually remake all of reality, Bel'Veth is willing to bargain and make deals with lesser beings that would oppose her, as she did with Kai'Sa .\nAs a well versed huntress of the Void , Kai'Sa is the natural enemy of Bel'Veth and aims to oppose everything she stands for. Bel'Veth however looks down at Kai'Sa, both with a form of admiration but also entertained by her foolishness in her attempts to stop her. Bel'Veth mostly admires Kai'Sa as she is one of the few individuals to retain their sanity after encountering the Void so much, with the only other individual being her own father Kassadin . During their first encounter, Kai'Sa continuously attempted to attack Bel'Veth with no effect. Bel'Veth offered Kai'Sa a deal to find a way to stop her creators the Watchers from completely erasing reality and, in return, Bel'Veth will give humanity a period of time before being consumed by her Lavender Sea , seeing her success as inevitable whether or not Kai'Sa assists her. [ 6 ]\nThough it's unclear whether or not Bel'Veth has personally encountered Kassadin, she is very much aware of him as one of the few people to retain their sanity after facing the Void alongside Kai'Sa, who she is aware of as her father. [ 6 ]\nAs Malzahar ventured through the lands of Shurima in search of his true destiny, he stumbled upon the ruins of Icathia and encountered the enigmatic powers of the Void. It's believed that he may have communicated with the Lavender Sea itself, suggesting that Bel'Veth was responsible for influencing his mind. [ 7 ]\nWhen the Lavender Sea desired a leader, it commanded Malzahar to find and gather enough minds to sacrifice to the Void so that it may birth one. This ultimately led him to open a rift in the city of Belveth, meaning he was the one responsible for her birth. [ 2 ] Bel'Veth considers Malzahar her prophet, using him to carry out her desires among mortals and rallying followers to reshape reality according to her own vision. [ 8 ]\nBecause of Bel'Veth's unique nature, she fights with other Voidborn due to their unwillingness to join her cause. Despite this, she actually speaks in high regards to her fellow Voidborn especially if they display more intelligence that can somewhat match her own, seeing potential for them to join her and evolve past the need to serve the Watchers.\nBecause of Vel'Koz's intelligence and continuous loyalty to the Watchers, he serves as a constant rival to Bel'Veth. She constantly taunts him for serving the Watchers to willingly, stating that they are incapable of seeing her vision of the Void. In turn, Vel'Koz may actually fear her in some regards. [ 9 ]\nThough it's unclear whether or not Bel'Veth herself has encountered any of the Xer'Sai, her own Voidborn spawn have encountered many of them in the Sai Kahleek . These Voidborn have been seen 'infecting' Xer'Sai hatchlings with a mysterious blue glow which is implied to put other Voidborn under Bel'Veth's control. [ 3 ]\nThe Lavender Sea, and in turn Bel'Veth, are initially constructs created by the Watchers when their reality first made contact with Runeterra . Because of her mutations even as a Voidborn, Bel'Veth has evolved past the need to serve the Watchers and has grown sentience, seeing her own vision for the Void that would remake and assimilate rather than destroy. She believes that the Watchers are incapable of understanding this vision, having a low opinion on her creators and doing everything in her power to defy them and the 'Old Void.' [ 9 ]\nRecently, she has made a deal with the Void huntress Kai'Sa, offering her and her people a chance at salvation if she finds a way to finally destroy the Watchers. [ 6 ]"}

Her shoulders have large spikes acting as shoulder pads and she wraps herself in her wings to mimic the appearance of a regal cloak, standing ten feet tall with a twenty-two foot wingspan. She has a tail that drags behind her with a massive bulb at the end.\nBel'Veth's true form is that of a golden stingray-like Voidborn , growing into a gargantuan size and revealing her 'face' to be a false head attached to a lure-like appendage. Her true face is revealed to be located at the center of her body where he chest would be; a massive gaping maw with teeth and four beady purple eyes. The protrusions on her shoulders are revealed to actually be horns on and her wings completely unfurl and appear as massive pectoral fins with pointed stingers at each tip.\nUnlike most Voidborn , Bel'Veth is sapient and individualistic due to the human qualities she consumed at her birth. Seeing herself as the embodiment of the true Void , her main goal is to assimilate all of Runeterra into the Lavender Sea and remake all of reality in her own perfected image. She is cold and immensely intelligent, having nigh-omniscience and the ability to calculate information at a humanely unfathomable rate. Because of this she is extremely arrogant, having calculated her plans so precisely that she genuinely sees her own success as an inevitability, though it's unclear whether or not this is genuine intelligence or just delusions of grandeur. Because of her arrogance, Bel'Veth sees herself as a superior being and looks down on most beings including her creators the Watchers . She is so certain of her success that she never lies, deciding only to state harsh truths as she sees it. In her efforts to eventually remake all of reality, Bel'Veth is willing to bargain and make deals with lesser beings that would oppose her, as she did with Kai'Sa .\nAs a well versed huntress of the Void , Kai'Sa is the natural enemy of Bel'Veth and aims to oppose everything she stands for. Bel'Veth however looks down at Kai'Sa, both with a form of admiration but also entertained by her foolishness in her attempts to stop her. Bel'Veth mostly admires Kai'Sa as she is one of the few individuals to retain their sanity after encountering the Void so much, with the only other individual being her own father Kassadin . During their first encounter, Kai'Sa continuously attempted to attack Bel'Veth with no effect. Bel'Veth offered Kai'Sa a deal to find a way to stop her creators the Watchers from completely erasing reality and, in return, Bel'Veth will give humanity a period of time before being consumed by her Lavender Sea , seeing her success as inevitable whether or not Kai'Sa assists her. [ 6 ]\nThough it's unclear whether or not Bel'Veth has personally encountered Kassadin, she is very much aware of him as one of the few people to retain their sanity after facing the Void alongside Kai'Sa, who she is aware of as her father. [ 6 ]\nAs Malzahar ventured through the lands of Shurima in search of his true destiny, he stumbled upon the ruins of Icathia and encountered the enigmatic powers of the Void. It's believed that he may have communicated with the Lavender Sea itself, suggesting that Bel'Veth was responsible for influencing his mind. [ 7 ]\nWhen the Lavender Sea desired a leader, it commanded Malzahar to find and gather enough minds to sacrifice to the Void so that it may birth one. This ultimately led him to open a rift in the city of Belveth, meaning he was the one responsible for her birth. [ 2 ] Bel'Veth considers Malzahar her prophet, using him to carry out her desires among mortals and rallying followers to reshape reality according to her own vision. [ 8 ]\nBecause of Bel'Veth's unique nature, she fights with other Voidborn due to their unwillingness to join her cause. Despite this, she actually speaks in high regards to her fellow Voidborn especially if they display more intelligence that can somewhat match her own, seeing potential for them to join her and evolve past the need to serve the Watchers.\nBecause of Vel'Koz's intelligence and continuous loyalty to the Watchers, he serves as a constant rival to Bel'Veth. She constantly taunts him for serving the Watchers to willingly, stating that they are incapable of seeing her vision of the Void. In turn, Vel'Koz may actually fear her in some regards. [ 9 ]\nThough it's unclear whether or not Bel'Veth herself has encountered any of the Xer'Sai, her own Voidborn spawn have encountered many of them in the Sai Kahleek . These Voidborn have been seen 'infecting' Xer'Sai hatchlings with a mysterious blue glow which is implied to put other Voidborn under Bel'Veth's control. [ 3 ]\nThe Lavender Sea, and in turn Bel'Veth, are initially constructs created by the Watchers when their reality first made contact with Runeterra . Because of her mutations even as a Voidborn, Bel'Veth has evolved past the need to serve the Watchers and has grown sentience, seeing her own vision for the Void that would remake and assimilate rather than destroy. She believes that the Watchers are incapable of understanding this vision, having a low opinion on her creators and doing everything in her power to defy them and the 'Old Void.' [ 9 ]\nRecently, she has made a deal with the Void huntress Kai'Sa, offering her and her people a chance at salvation if she finds a way to finally destroy the Watchers. [ 6 ]"}

Created to descend into the most caustic and dangerous of environments in Zaun to dispose of harmful waste, they have evolved beyond the bounds of their original programming, thanks to the genius of their inventor, and the mysterious power of hextech .\nAfter a massive chem-spill devastated entire districts of Zaun , a series of mechanical golems were sent out to clean up the mess. Designed to remove the toxic waste claiming the neighborhoods, these lumbering golems, toiled continuously in extremely hazardous locations, fulfilling their programming to better the city for the people of Zaun. Eventually, one particular golem was rendered inoperative, discarded as useless scrap. It wasn't until the esteemed inventor Viktor discovered the abandoned golem, seeing the potential within its inert chassis. Viktor ran a series of experiments to improve the automaton, implanting a priceless hextech crystal from the deserts of Shurima into the forsaken golem as an immense upgrade.\nAs the machine rumbled to life, Viktor named it Blitzcrank after the fizzing arcs of lighting that danced around their frame; an unexpected side effect of the hextech crystal within their chassis. As Blitzcrank was sent down into the most toxic parts of Zaun, they proved more than capable of laboring just like their steam-powered brethren. However, Viktor witnessed Blitzcrank miraculously accomplish tasks with vastly improved speed and efficiency, realizing that his custom-built golem had actually been learning rather than simply laboring.\nAs Blitzcrank continued to clean up the chemical spills of Zaun, they began to innovate, interpret and extrapolate on their daily directives, serving the people of Zaun much further. Blitzcrank's intelligence would grow so much that they would interact with the Zaunite citizens on a regular basis, something unheard of for a laboring steam golem. Meanwhile, Viktor would attempt to replicate his achievement to no avail, as origin of Blitzcrank's blossoming consciousness became complete enigma to him, but most likely the product of the hextech crystal.\nAs Blitzcrank continued to learn and grow, concepts such as moderation and nuance remained alien to the golem, as Blitzcrank would persue any effort with their entirety or not at all. This would cause Blitzcrank to overdo or misinterpret requests at times, such as smashing down the front of a tenement to help a single resident who lost their keys. At one point, Viktor dispatched Blitzcrank to clean up runoff of caustic chemicals. Reasoning that the most efficient means to prevent further pollution was to eliminate the source of said pollution, Blitzcrank proceeded to destroy the factory, their lightning-wreathed fists not stopping until it was reduced to a mound of rubble and twisted iron.\nA local chem-baron who had owned the factory became enraged when Blitzcrank destroyed it, demanding that Viktor either destroy the golem or pay a steeper price in blood. Viktor became devastated, having witnessed Blitzcrank's growth in sentience and considering them a living being. He eventually concocted a scheme to smuggle Blitzcrank to safety, but discovered that his creation had already left to ensure the safety of their creator as the two parted ways. However, as Viktor returned to Piltover to continue his studies, he discovered that his teacher Professor Stanwick had actually held a symposium about Blitzcrank, presenting their creation as his own and taking Viktor's credit. [ 1 ]\nHaving grown into self-sufficiency, Blitzcrank decided to take up their own mission independent of their creator, looking to resolve Zaun's local problems and better life for its citizens their own way. They would often patrol the city, serving to assist and protect any Zaunites without pausing for instruction. Always searching for any problems in need of solution, Blitzcrank aims to shepherd Zaun down the path of becoming the greatest city in the world. It's also rumored that Blitzcrank has slowly been upgrading their own form, adding modifications to their own body to help further their goal.\nWhile swinging around Zaun with their rocket arms, Blitzcrank found themself at the Rising Howl, a massive Hexdraulic Conveyor designed to allow vertical travel between the Sump to the Boundary Markets atop Zaun. Blitzcrank stopped at the elevator to enjoy the noise and unique sounds from the massive machine, curiously surveying the many passengers riding it.\nAs the Howl began to descend from the Entresol level, it abruptly jammed, causing a terrible malfunction as it painfully braced against the support beams before dropping entirely. As the elevator quickly fell and the passengers screamed, Blitzcrank attempted to grasp onto the support beams and stop the Howl from falling. During the chaos, a young boy almost fell out of the Howl's window before Blitzcrank grasped him with his arm mid-air. Blitzcrank eventually managed to grasp onto the support beams, abruptly stopping the elevator and saving the lives of all the passengers. Once the elevator began to stabilize, the Howl's passengers were directed to medical workers by the conductor, who graciously thanked the golem. Blitzcrank simply responded by saying they were 'fulfilling their purpose' before bidding the passengers a good day. [ 2 ]\nBlitzcrank helped out Ekko when he was fighting a gang of chempunks, grabbing some of them and blasting them with a wave of electricity to protect the young boy. [ 3 ] After this, he would quickly befriend Ekko and the rest of his gang, including Zeri . At one point, Blitzcrank became badly damaged after a violent encounter with a couple of scrappers, causing the detachment of their arm. Luckily, Zeri was nearby to help save and repair them. [ 4 ]\nBlitzcrank is a big Techmaturgical Golem build out of golden/bronze colored steel plating. It has a big steam engine attached to its back which it retained from its original creation. Their body is staticly electrified by the Hextech crystal within them. This is most notable around the screws that represent their knuckles.\nUnlike other Techmaturgical Golems , Blitzcrank is able to learn and adapt, similar to artifical intelligence . Despite its imposing size and cold steel, Blitzcrank is a kind hearted, altruistic golem and will lend a helping hand to anyone in Zaun who needs it.\nCreated in the service of Zaun , Blitzcrank prides themself in protecting the citizens of Zaun from the chemical spill that dots the city's landscape. Far more efficient than their peers , they were able to clean up multiple spills without sustaining any damage that would have cause for repair.\nAfter a while Blitzcrank was learning beyond what their initial directives had set out for them. They started to innovate, interpreting and extrapolating on their daily directives. As a result, they did far more to serve the people of Zaun, and even began to interact with them on a regular basis.\nViktor discovered a Golem , after it was abandoned because it was rendered inoperative. In a stroke of brilliance, Viktor implanted a Hextech crystal into the machine that would elevate it far beyond the original scope of its creation. After the machine rumbled to life, Viktor named his new creation Blitzcrank after the fizzing arcs of lightning that danced around their frame.

Seeking one of the legendary World Runes, Kegan betrayed his companions and seized it for himself—and, in an instant, the man was no more. His soul burned away, his body a vessel of living flame, Brand now roams Valoran in search of other Runes, swearing revenge for wrongs he could never possibly have suffered in a dozen mortal lifetimes.\nBrand was born as Kegan Rodhe in the Freljord , in the region of Lokfar in a settlement called Rygann's Reach. His mother was a healer and his father was a reaver. Because of this and the fact that his father never stayed to raise him, he earned the nickname \"Reaver-Bastard\" among the people of Rygann's Reach.\nKegan and his mother were shunned from the settlement, with the only reason they weren't banished from the settlement entirely being that Kegan's mother healed the denisons of Rygann's Reach. Due to all of this, Kegan was often the subject of ridicule from the townspeople, often being called names and getting in fights. His only friend was Zvanna, a local girl he met shortly after she and her family had moved to Rygann's reach. Kegan and Zvanna were lovers for a time, but stopped at some point for unknown reasons, most likely because of Kegan's temper against the townspeople that were cruel to him.\nAfter the death of his mother, Kegan was informed by Zvanna that the Townspeople of Rygann's Reach wanted him to leave. After packing up and getting ready to leave, Kegan snuck into the home of Rygann, the leader of Rygann's Reach and the person that Kegan hated and blamed the most for what he and his mother had to endure during their stay at the town. He poured gasoline on the floor of the home and as Rygann woke up, Kegan told Rygann that he and all the other townspeople had killed his mother by slowly wearing her away with how they treated her and that he was now sending Kegan out to die. He then set the house on fire.\nAfter burning himself in the fire that he started, Kegan walked away intending to leave Rygann's Reach and go into the wilderness. After getting on top of a hill, Kegan looked back and saw that the fire had spread throughout the entire settlement. Realizing that Zvanna's home had burned down, he ran back to find her. He found her dead body laying next to her family's bodies. After kneeling beside them for a time, he went into the wilderness to find another settlement.\nKegan wandered through the wilderness for weeks, hunting wildlife to survive. He had wandered into a cave hoping to wait out a blizzard when Ryze walked into the cave and healed him of his frostbite and his severe burns from the fire at Rygann's Reach. Ryze saw potential in Kegan and decided to take him as his apprentice.\nAfter Kegan had been Ryze's apprentice for a time, they tracked down a World Rune, a magical artifact that could give the user a large amount of magical power. After obtaining it, Kegan chose to keep and use the World Rune for his own gain. The Rune transformed Kegan, making the creature who would eventually come to be known as Brand. A shadow of the man he once was, Brand began his search for more World Runes.\nBrand has burned grey and black skin. This skin is interrupted by an orange streak along his chest that eminates light. His hands and scalp are this same shade of orange and are continuously on fire. Crevices where his eyes and mouth would be are replaced with orange light. Brand wears nothing but a pair of brown pants with belts around each leg, with the lower half of these pants being burned off.\nKegan Rodhe was an angry man, bitter towards the denizens of Rygann's Reach for how they treated him and his mother. He had an explosive temper, often resorting to him yelling, or more often using violence at those who angered him.\nAfter transforming into Brand, the World Rune took full control of Kegan's body, becoming a cataclysmic pyromaniac obsessed with gaining more power and burning the world to ash, seeing mortals as weak and wishing to rule as a god. He is obsessed with hunting down his vessel's former master Ryze , trying to tempt him to rule with the World-Runes' power alongside him, and taunting him when his apprentice Kala nearly gave in to the temptation of a World-Rune. [ 1 ] It is shown that Brand's personality was influenced by the World-Rune tempting Kegan to getting revenge on the world for how he had been treated, reducing Kegan to nothing more than the embodiment of his desire for vengeance. [ 2 ]\nSince he was young, Kegan was ostracized by the villagers of Rygann's Reach for being a son of a reaver and therefore being a symbol of bad luck in the village, insulting him with the moniker \"reaver-bastard\". Throughout Kegan's life the villagers subjected him to constant physical and verbal abuse, causing him to develop an aggressive and resentful personality. After his mother's death, he wished to take out his hatred towards the village for not grieving her death after she had overworked herself to death for their sake, though he blamed Rygann for stoking their beliefs in the first place. After the villagers witnessed his role in Zvanna's death, they mocked him again as he left the village. Even after going his separate ways, Kegan's bitterness from all of the torment his fellows subjected to him never faded, which allowed the World-Rune to tempt him into becoming Brand, leaving Kegan's personality as nothing but his resentment towards the world.\nKrezia is Kegan's mother, whom was also shunned and outcasted by the village. She wanted to resign herself and Kegan to their cruel treatment fearing that they would be exiled and left to die in the wilderness. Due to her paranoia, she tried to urge her son not to make things worse for the both of them, but he remained defiant and said he refused to be a coward like her. Despite her protectiveness towards her son, Krezia was also abusive towards Kegan due to him being a constant reminder of her husband and his crime which caused them both to be outcasts in the first place. Even so, Kegan grieved his mother's death and burned down Rygann's Reach to avenge her and the cruelty suffered by her alongside himself.\nKegan first met Zvanna at the age of thirteen. She was the only person in the village who treated him kindly, so the two developed a friendship which later became a romance, though their relationship didn't last as Zvanna split up with him and later married Malvir, disappointing Kegan as he had lost the love of the only person who cared about him. Zvanna later told Kegan about Old Rygann's decree to exiled, feeling saddened towards him and offering him food to help him survive, though Kegan refused as he wanted to die in his exile. Later, Kegan's attempt to burn down the village ended up accidentally killing Zvanna and her family in the collateral damage, and he felt heavy remorse for causing her death.\nOld Rygann perpetuated his people's beliefs that the Rodhe family was bad luck, playing a role in the abuse they were subjected to. He wished to exile both Krezia and Kegan but only kept them due to the former's abilities to heal the villagers. Once Krezia died, Rygann had Kegan exiled as he no longer had worth for the village. Of all the people whom mistreated him, Kegan hated Rygann the most due to his role in Krezia's death, so Kegan came to his hut, threatening him with a knife while admonishing him for the way he treated him and his mother, before using his lantern to burn down Rygann's hut and by extent the entire village to get revenge.\nBrand was once a student of Ryze when he was still known as Kegan Rodhe. After Brand's transformation, they became enemies, with Brand intent on finding and gaining possession of another World Rune, which directly conflicts with Ryze's objective of making sure that nobody can find or use any other World Runes again."}

Every mead hall north of Frostheld toasts his legendary strength and tells tales of how he felled a forest of oaks in a single night, and punched an entire mountain into rubble. With his shield, an enchanted vault door forged in ages past , Braum roams the frozen north as a cheerful protector, helping the vulnerable as he works toward his dream of a peaceful Freljord.\nAs a child, Braum was larger than other Freljordian youths. His mother taught him not to use his size to intimidate or bully and taught him that true courage was not about dominating, but helping those in need. One day, an enemy tribe was attacked by ice giants and Braum's mother did not hesitate to help them. Braum was confused why she would help their enemies, but thanks to her kindness, said tribe became allies. Braum then understood his mother's philosophy that all of the Freljord was a family, and he pledged to bring that family together. Braum helped people in his home town by saving them from danger and bringing hope wherever he goes.\nEventually, he realized that he was needed in more places than his home, so he bid his mother a tearful farewell as he went off on his quest. His heroism and good deeds inspired people all over the Freljord to tell stories about his feats, but some were unrealistic and exaggerated. One myth told that Braum's signature shield was an indestructible vault door made by the demigod Ornn, which he broke from its hinges by punching the rocks surrounding it in order to save a troll boy trapped within. Braum laughed heartily at the stories he'd heard about himself, but rather than refuting them, he embraces them, as he won't let the truth get in the way of inspiring others.\nBraum later travelled to Rakelstake to hear the words of Ashe, a leader of the Avarosan , a tribe who followed the teachings Avarosa of the Three Sisters , whom Ashe is said to be the reincarnation of. There he also met Tryndamere, a barbarian who was determined to prove his worth by dominating every opponent he could face. In one duel, Tryndamere became increasingly lost in his fury and was actually about to kill his opponent, but Braum intervened by holding up his shield, and Tryndamere kept attacking the impenetrable shield until his rage subsided. After that, they became good friends, and it is even said that Braum was the one who introduced Tryndamere to Ashe, his now wife.\nBraum has no specific allegiance, as he believes that all within the Freljord are brothers and sisters. He is reliant on Ashe as they both share a goal to unite the region, and the Avarosans have adopted him as their own. He often tells adoring children that he wishes for the Frejlord to settle their differences and then retire to become a poro herder.\nBraum sees no-one as an enemy of his. However, the Frostguard, led by Lissandra, are hunting for him and he does not understand what they want from him. Still, he has fought against the Frostguard's forces numerous times in order to defend innocents threatened by them.\nSometime before the events of Ruined king, Braum hears of a sickness that is plaguing the Freljord's children. While visiting a village, one of the elders mentions that when he was a boy, his father told him of the waters of the Blessed Isles . Although warning Braum of the dangers of visiting the Isles,  Braum sets sail for the Isles in search of a cure.\nUpon reaching the Isles, his boat is attacked by the Black Mist and Braum is force to abandon ship, losing his shield. Thought dead, he was rescued by the Buhru. Once there, he helps the people of Bilgewater by bringing a massive sea creature into the docks with his bear hands. Illaoi , who had just returned from facing the Bloodharbor Ripper, investigates Braum's feat, amazed by his strength. Together with Illaoi, Miss Fortune , Ahri , Yasuo , and Pyke , he helps in stopping the Ruined King.\nOnce on the isles, they met Maokai , who, after healing him, offered his leaves — infused with the remaining Water of Life — to cure Braum's people. Together, the breached Thresh 's libraries of agony and took Gangplank back into custody. Returning to Bilgewater, Braum caught rumor of a strange shipwreck, with beams of blue light emerging from the sea. Recognizing the ship as his own, he found the ship and recovered his shield.\nFollowing their triumph over Viego , The group celebrated their victory and parted ways. Braum returned to the Freljord, escorted by Yasuo, who was on a journey to Noxus in search of Riven .\nBraum met Nunu and Willump when he saved them from a pack of arctic wolves.\nBraum is a large, fair-skinned, bald man with comically large muscles and brown mustache. He has a large tattoo that covers from his left arm to his pectoral. He wears a large shoulder pad on his right shoulder that connects to a large belt buckle with a symbol of a ram's head, representing his connection to Ornn . He carries a large shield with a ram's head forged in the center.\nAs his title suggests, he has a heart of pure gold; Braum is a selfless, friendly man who enjoys helping people, simply because he likes being altruistic and hopes that his actions will inspire others. Ever since witnessing his mother's act of kindness on a neighboring tribe despite being enemies, he has taken his mother's teachings to heart and sees worth in all of the Freljord 's people, calling them all a family of brothers and sisters, and is able to make friends with anyone, regardless of their character. Braum's feats have inspired many myths, but Braum himself accepts the stories about himself no matter how inaccurate they may be, since he knows that people will be inspired to acts of generosity and kindness after his example.\nBraum's original tribe has a strong tie to Ornn and hence his magic takes the shape of the ram. Ornn is responsible for forging the door that would later be wielded by Braum. However, Braum is not aware of this fact.\nThe Frostguard is hostile toward Braum.\nBraum doesn’t hold any particular tribal allegiance with any tribe as he views all within the Freljord as brothers and sisters. However, he is particularly friendly toward Ashe's and the Avarosan , believing that Ashe may unite the Freljord.\nBraum stopped Tryndamere 's fury when he first arrived at the Rakelstake and may have introduced him to Ashe .\nDuring his travels, he has encountered Yuumi and Book of Thresholds .

Over the course of the adventure, Braum and Illaoi develop a friendship.

Every mead hall north of Frostheld toasts his legendary strength and tells tales of how he felled a forest of oaks in a single night, and punched an entire mountain into rubble. With his shield, an enchanted vault door forged in ages past , Braum roams the frozen north as a cheerful protector, helping the vulnerable as he works toward his dream of a peaceful Freljord.\nAs a child, Braum was larger than other Freljordian youths. His mother taught him not to use his size to intimidate or bully and taught him that true courage was not about dominating, but helping those in need. One day, an enemy tribe was attacked by ice giants and Braum's mother did not hesitate to help them. Braum was confused why she would help their enemies, but thanks to her kindness, said tribe became allies. Braum then understood his mother's philosophy that all of the Freljord was a family, and he pledged to bring that family together. Braum helped people in his home town by saving them from danger and bringing hope wherever he goes.\nEventually, he realized that he was needed in more places than his home, so he bid his mother a tearful farewell as he went off on his quest. His heroism and good deeds inspired people all over the Freljord to tell stories about his feats, but some were unrealistic and exaggerated.

After years of confinement, this living weapon broke free from her restraints and unleashed herself into the world. Now she’s controlled by no one—following only her hunger for knowledge and blood—and relishes the opportunities to let loose, even if reining back the frenzy isn’t easy.\nThe magical pillory created by the Black Rose to restrain and control Briar.\nBriar was created near the end of Boram Darkwill's reign by the Black Rose's hemomancers. She was designed to be a new type of living weapon created purely out of blood magic and not requiring sustenance to survive.\nThough designed to be a perfect assassin, Briar was completely driven by a hunger for blood, entering a constant state of hemomania. Despite this, the Black Rose sent Briar off on her first mission which ended in a gory failure as Briar entered a frenzy and killed everyone indiscriminately. Realizing she was too dangerous to control, the Black Rose created a special pillory with a hemolith gemstone to both restrain and focus her mind, taming her hemomanic instincts completely.\nWhen the disgraced general Jericho Swain began his coup over the Noxian empire, the Black Rose quickly deployed many of their living weapons and experiments to fight him off. Briar was deployed among them and had the special job of killing Swain himself. Once she was given to a handler to help direct her, Briar was released from her pillory and immediately devoured him and everyone around her. Unfortunately, Swain managed to escape her bloody frenzy and his guards managed to capture her, restoring Briar's pillory. Now restrained, Swain was able to transfer Briar to a holding facility, locking her in a cell with many other living experiments that had been employed by the Black Rose.\nAlone in her cell, Briar was unable to die from starvation and simply focused on her hunger. Initially thinking the many crazed wails of the neighboring cells were her own voices, Briar came to realize they were other living weapons like her that were captured. While listening to them however, she began to realize how boring and single-minded her neighbors were. Not wishing to become like them, Briar instead decided to seclude herself in solitude within her cell.\nBriar sat in solitary confinement for years, finding entertainment in eavesdropping her guards' conversations, pestering them for raw meat and agonizing whether she should race her pet spiders or eat them. She would eventually wonder about the world outside of her cell and, while toying with her restraint, managed to loosen the hemolith in her pillory. She thought about the neighboring hemomaniacs and their simple-minded hunger for blood and decided that she wanted to be something more, finding a balance between being calm and frenzied.\nNow with a newfound purpose, Briar wanted to finally see the outside world and devised a plan to escape her prison. Though the guards were used to her calling for attention, one particular guard was lured closer to Briar's cell, allowing her to attack him and feast on his blood, giving her enough strength to break out.\nBriar gleefully escaping her cell.\nEager and excited to escape, Briar quickly befriended a young janitor who she mistakenly assumed was escaping with her. When she saw the prison guards roughly shove the janitor away to safety, Briar got angry and managed to break her pillory, going into a hemomanic frenzy and brutally defeating many of the guards while trying to follow her new janitor 'friend.' Once outside of the prison gates, Briar reconstructed her pillory and gazed at the outside world, free to explore the world beyond and feast on all the blood she wants. [ 2 ] Now, she wanders the streets of Noxus , learning more about the world beyond her cell and wishing to make new friends. The Black Rose, curious about Briar's unexpected development, have been secretly monitoring their living weapon for currently unknown purposes.\nBriar is a pale humanoid girl with grey skin and white hair dyed with blood. Her eyes are cataracted with huge white pupils resembling the full moon and bright pink sclera. Briar's claws and teeth are incredibly sharp and she has pointed ears resembling a bat's. There are metal bolts on her shoulder-blades capable of emitting magical energy for propulsion. She appears very thin and almost emaciated but her bottom half is a bit heavier. She wears a black corset-like outfit adorned with many black, leather straps and some red, wax seals on the belts on her hip. Her bottom half simply has some black bandages covering her legs, leaving her feet bare with metal stakes stabbing through her ankles. She is restrained by an arch-shaped pillory adorned with many spikes and runic symbols that glow a dark red, held together by a hemolith gemstone in the middle of it.\nIn her hemomanic state, Briar shatters her pillory and her hair stands on end. Her face morphs into a savage expression with glowing red eyes and an extended tongue. The cuffs of her pillory form sharp red daggers, which can be empowered with blood magic to become longer blades made of blood.\nBriar's defining characteristic is her never-ending hunger for blood, with her instincts drawing her to kill both her allies and enemies indiscriminately so she can eat them. After developing independence as a result of her imprisonment, she became excitable and carefree, always displaying a childlike sense of wonder. She has more control over her hunger and is more open to befriending others, though she is willing to unleash her hemomanic instincts if she needs to.\nBriar was created by the Black Rose's hemomancers as a living weapon. After she proved to be too dangerous to keep unrestrained after her first mission failed, they bound her in a special pillory designed with a hemolith gemstone meant to keep her mind focused and under control. She was later deployed by the Black Rose to kill Jericho Swain during his coup, but lost control and was ultimately imprisoned by Swain and his guards.\nAfter Briar broke out of Swain's holding facility, the Black Rose continue to monitor and spy on her as she wanders the streets of Noxus, intrigued by her sudden development into a more sentient being.\nBriar was created with hemomancy, a magical art strongly tied to Vladimir, a founding member of the Black Rose. Though his exact relationship with Briar is unclear, it's heavily implied that he was mainly responsible for her creation. As her creator, Briar somewhat considers Vladimir her 'dad,' though she questions whether or not to actually call him that.\nThe annotated sketch used for Briar splash art states that she is at Vladimir's castle, acting as a guard dog. [ 3 ] Whether this is true for the characters is unclear, however it does imply a possible relationship between the two after Briar escape.\nBoram Darkwill is the one who entrusted the Black Rose to create living weapons towards the end of his reign and mainly oversaw the creation of Briar as a perfect assassin. When the Black Rose deployed her to kill Jericho Swain during his coup, she failed and was captured by his guards, allowing Swain to eventually take over Noxus and kill Darkwill.\nBriar was sent to kill Swain during his coup but proved too difficult to control as she managed to kill everybody around her except for her target. As Swain managed to escape, his guards captured and restored Briar's pillory restraint, transporting her to a secret holding facility with several other living weapons sent to kill him by the Black Rose. Eventually, Briar managed to escape the facility, killing many of the guards and now roaming the streets of Noxus.\nSion is another hemomancy experiment conducted by the Black Rose as they attempted to revive him using blood magic.

After years of confinement, this living weapon broke free from her restraints and unleashed herself into the world. Now she’s controlled by no one—following only her hunger for knowledge and blood—and relishes the opportunities to let loose, even if reining back the frenzy isn’t easy.\nThe magical pillory created by the Black Rose to restrain and control Briar.\nBriar was created near the end of Boram Darkwill's reign by the Black Rose's hemomancers. She was designed to be a new type of living weapon created purely out of blood magic and not requiring sustenance to survive.\nThough designed to be a perfect assassin, Briar was completely driven by a hunger for blood, entering a constant state of hemomania. Despite this, the Black Rose sent Briar off on her first mission which ended in a gory failure as Briar entered a frenzy and killed everyone indiscriminately. Realizing she was too dangerous to control, the Black Rose created a special pillory with a hemolith gemstone to both restrain and focus her mind, taming her hemomanic instincts completely.\nWhen the disgraced general Jericho Swain began his coup over the Noxian empire, the Black Rose quickly deployed many of their living weapons and experiments to fight him off. Briar was deployed among them and had the special job of killing Swain himself. Once she was given to a handler to help direct her, Briar was released from her pillory and immediately devoured him and everyone around her. Unfortunately, Swain managed to escape her bloody frenzy and his guards managed to capture her, restoring Briar's pillory. Now restrained, Swain was able to transfer Briar to a holding facility, locking her in a cell with many other living experiments that had been employed by the Black Rose.\nAlone in her cell, Briar was unable to die from starvation and simply focused on her hunger. Initially thinking the many crazed wails of the neighboring cells were her own voices, Briar came to realize they were other living weapons like her that were captured. While listening to them however, she began to realize how boring and single-minded her neighbors were. Not wishing to become like them, Briar instead decided to seclude herself in solitude within her cell.\nBriar sat in solitary confinement for years, finding entertainment in eavesdropping her guards' conversations, pestering them for raw meat and agonizing whether she should race her pet spiders or eat them. She would eventually wonder about the world outside of her cell and, while toying with her restraint, managed to loosen the hemolith in her pillory. She thought about the neighboring hemomaniacs and their simple-minded hunger for blood and decided that she wanted to be something more, finding a balance between being calm and frenzied.\nNow with a newfound purpose, Briar wanted to finally see the outside world and devised a plan to escape her prison. Though the guards were used to her calling for attention, one particular guard was lured closer to Briar's cell, allowing her to attack him and feast on his blood, giving her enough strength to break out.\nBriar gleefully escaping her cell.\nEager and excited to escape, Briar quickly befriended a young janitor who she mistakenly assumed was escaping with her. When she saw the prison guards roughly shove the janitor away to safety, Briar got angry and managed to break her pillory, going into a hemomanic frenzy and brutally defeating many of the guards while trying to follow her new janitor 'friend.' Once outside of the prison gates, Briar reconstructed her pillory and gazed at the outside world, free to explore the world beyond and feast on all the blood she wants. [ 2 ] Now, she wanders the streets of Noxus , learning more about the world beyond her cell and wishing to make new friends. The Black Rose, curious about Briar's unexpected development, have been secretly monitoring their living weapon for currently unknown purposes.\nBriar is a pale humanoid girl with grey skin and white hair dyed with blood. Her eyes are cataracted with huge white pupils resembling the full moon and bright pink sclera. Briar's claws and teeth are incredibly sharp and she has pointed ears resembling a bat's. There are metal bolts on her shoulder-blades capable of emitting magical energy for propulsion. She appears very thin and almost emaciated but her bottom half is a bit heavier. She wears a black corset-like outfit adorned with many black, leather straps and some red, wax seals on the belts on her hip. Her bottom half simply has some black bandages covering her legs, leaving her feet bare with metal stakes stabbing through her ankles. She is restrained by an arch-shaped pillory adorned with many spikes and runic symbols that glow a dark red, held together by a hemolith gemstone in the middle of it.\nIn her hemomanic state, Briar shatters her pillory and her hair stands on end. Her face morphs into a savage expression with glowing red eyes and an extended tongue. The cuffs of her pillory form sharp red daggers, which can be empowered with blood magic to become longer blades made of blood.\nBriar's defining characteristic is her never-ending hunger for blood, with her instincts drawing her to kill both her allies and enemies indiscriminately so she can eat them. After developing independence as a result of her imprisonment, she became excitable and carefree, always displaying a childlike sense of wonder. She has more control over her hunger and is more open to befriending others, though she is willing to unleash her hemomanic instincts if she needs to.\nBriar was created by the Black Rose's hemomancers as a living weapon. After she proved to be too dangerous to keep unrestrained after her first mission failed, they bound her in a special pillory designed with a hemolith gemstone meant to keep her mind focused and under control. She was later deployed by the Black Rose to kill Jericho Swain during his coup, but lost control and was ultimately imprisoned by Swain and his guards.\nAfter Briar broke out of Swain's holding facility, the Black Rose continue to monitor and spy on her as she wanders the streets of Noxus, intrigued by her sudden development into a more sentient being.\nBriar was created with hemomancy, a magical art strongly tied to Vladimir, a founding member of the Black Rose. Though his exact relationship with Briar is unclear, it's heavily implied that he was mainly responsible for her creation. As her creator, Briar somewhat considers Vladimir her 'dad,' though she questions whether or not to actually call him that.\nThe annotated sketch used for Briar splash art states that she is at Vladimir's castle, acting as a guard dog. [ 3 ] Whether this is true for the characters is unclear, however it does imply a possible relationship between the two after Briar escape.\nBoram Darkwill is the one who entrusted the Black Rose to create living weapons towards the end of his reign and mainly oversaw the creation of Briar as a perfect assassin. When the Black Rose deployed her to kill Jericho Swain during his coup, she failed and was captured by his guards, allowing Swain to eventually take over Noxus and kill Darkwill.\nBriar was sent to kill Swain during his coup but proved too difficult to control as she managed to kill everybody around her except for her target. As Swain managed to escape, his guards captured and restored Briar's pillory restraint, transporting her to a secret holding facility with several other living weapons sent to kill him by the Black Rose. Eventually, Briar managed to escape the facility, killing many of the guards and now roaming the streets of Noxus.\nSion is another hemomancy experiment conducted by the Black Rose as they attempted to revive him using blood magic. As one of their many experiments, Sion was also imprisoned in the same facility as Briar, being held in a cell neighboring hers. Sion was one of the many experiments that annoyed Briar during her imprisonment, seeing him as boring and simple. Their exact relationship isn't entirely known, but Briar seems disappointed and annoyed to see that Sion escaped the facility as well."}

She is often paired with Vi , acting as a cool counterpoint to her partner’s more impetuous nature. Even though she carries a one-of-a-kind hextech rifle, Caitlyn’s most powerful weapon is her superior intellect, allowing her to lay elaborate traps for any lawbreakers foolish enough to operate in the City of Progress.\nBorn into a wealthy and influential merchant clan, Caitlyn Kiramman swiftly learned the social graces of life in Piltover, but preferred to spend her time in the wilder lands outside it. Equally adept at mingling with the moneyed elite of the City of Progress or stalking a deer through the mud of the forest, she could confidently track a bird on the wing over the merchant districts, or put a shot through the eye of a hare at a hundred paces with her father’s repeater musket.\nCaitlyn’s greatest assets, however, were her intelligence and willingness to learn from her parents, who reinforced her understanding of right and wrong, even within a life of comfort and privilege. Her mother was one of the highest comptrollers in Clan Kiramman, and would always warn Caitlyn of Piltover’s seductions, and its gilded promises that could harden the kindest heart. At first, Caitlyn paid little heed—to her, Piltover was a place of beauty and order that she cherished after each trip into the wild.\nAll that was to change one Progress Day, some years later...\nCaitlyn returned to find her home ransacked and empty. The family retainers were all dead, and there was no trace of her parents. Caitlyn secured the house, and immediately set out to find them.\nTracking within the confines of a city was very different from hunting in the wild but, one by one, Caitlyn located the thugs who had invaded her family home. The trail eventually led her to a hidden safehouse, where her mother and father were being tortured for information. She rescued them under cover of darkness, and alerted the Piltover Wardens… though not one of the kidnappers they arrested knew the identity of the individual who had hired them—only a proxy with the initial C .\nCaitlyn and her parents began to rebuild their lives… but something fundamental had changed. Her mother in particular could no longer face the politics and duplicity of clan life, and gave up her prestigious role, leaving something of a vacuum in the Kiramman leadership. And, though she loved her parents dearly, Caitlyn had no desire to take her mother’s place, nor to learn her father’s trade as an artificer.\nInstead, her focus turned toward breaking through the web of intrigue surrounding the mysterious \"C\". Utilizing her hunting skills, she established herself as a private investigator, and quickly made a name for herself as someone who could find anything or anyone. In recognition of her self-made success, Caitlyn’s parents crafted her a hextech rifle of exquisite artifice, with greater accuracy than any musket. The weapon could take a variety of specialized shells, and be easily modified in the field.\nAfter a particularly traumatic case involving a missing hextech device and a series of child abductions, Caitlyn was summoned by the Wardens.\nShe had been recommended by one of their number who had also developed something of an affinity for stranger cases—and their battle with a host of rogue chimerics in the employ of a lunatic chem-researcher driven mad by his own concoctions led to her being offered a formal position as a sheriff. At first, Caitlyn refused, but eventually came to realize that the Wardens’ resources could potentially get her closer to discovering the true identity of “C\".\nCaitlyn has since become a highly respected officer within the ranks of the Wardens, always striving to make the City of Progress a better and safer place. She recently partnered with a new recruit from Zaun, the brash and reckless Vi. How such an unlikely pairing came about—and been proven so effective—is the subject of wild rumor and tavern speculation among their fellow Wardens, as well as those they haul away to jail.\nWhat Caitlyn doesn't know, however, is that \"C\" is also keeping tabs on her... especially as her investigations bring her ever closer to the truth.\nCaitlyn's height is above average, standing 6'1 tall and slim but muscular build with pale skin, back-length dark blue hair, and piercing deep blue eyes. She is part Piltovan and Ionian.\nHer outfit is a combination of white, dark blue, and bronze colors. She consists of a sheriff's uniform with a short navy blue skirt, long navy blue stockings with embellishments and bronze heeled boots and she always wears a matching top hat with the uniform which gives her a classy yet intimidating look.\nCaitlyn is a woman who is very devoted to the community of Piltover. She enjoys her work as a sheriff, where she assists citizens and apprehends criminals while ensuring they have a fair trial, demonstrating that she is fair to both good and bad people.\nShe is strict, disciplined, and level-headed. She will use legal means to ensure that her work is meticulous and routine. These characteristics are what distinguishes her as an effective detective. However, Caitlyn can also be somewhat rebellious, as she has been known to break the rules at times in order to carry out her duty, such as allowing Vi, a woman from Zaun, to join her and chaperone her on missions. There have been rumors that her and Vi's relationship is more than just professional or a friendship.\nCaitlyn has proven to be a very compassionate person after witnessing the state of Zaun; she works together with Vi to protect the city, and prevent the corruption from continuing.\nDespite her maturity and elegance, she is a big fan of Seraphine and will drop all said traits to being giddy and excitable should she be around.\nCaitlyn earned her position as sheriff for her incredible use of firearms, especially in the rifle that is her favorite weapon, she never misses and Vi described her aim as impeccable.\nCaitlyn and Vi are partners-in-law-enforcement. They have been working together for a long time so much that their relationship is speculated to be more than friendship and professional. They've been chasing after Jinx who is Vi's sister and a dangerous criminal who's been wreaking havoc in Piltover. They managed to stop a turmoil caused by Urgot and his followers, caught him and later put him in an isolated island prison. The duo later fight him again when his followers try to free him from his prison."}

She is often paired with Vi , acting as a cool counterpoint to her partner’s more impetuous nature. Even though she carries a one-of-a-kind hextech rifle, Caitlyn’s most powerful weapon is her superior intellect, allowing her to lay elaborate traps for any lawbreakers foolish enough to operate in the City of Progress.\nBorn into a wealthy and influential merchant clan, Caitlyn Kiramman swiftly learned the social graces of life in Piltover, but preferred to spend her time in the wilder lands outside it. Equally adept at mingling with the moneyed elite of the City of Progress or stalking a deer through the mud of the forest, she could confidently track a bird on the wing over the merchant districts, or put a shot through the eye of a hare at a hundred paces with her father’s repeater musket.\nCaitlyn’s greatest assets, however, were her intelligence and willingness to learn from her parents, who reinforced her understanding of right and wrong, even within a life of comfort and privilege. Her mother was one of the highest comptrollers in Clan Kiramman, and would always warn Caitlyn of Piltover’s seductions, and its gilded promises that could harden the kindest heart. At first, Caitlyn paid little heed—to her, Piltover was a place of beauty and order that she cherished after each trip into the wild.\nAll that was to change one Progress Day, some years later...\nCaitlyn returned to find her home ransacked and empty. The family retainers were all dead, and there was no trace of her parents. Caitlyn secured the house, and immediately set out to find them.\nTracking within the confines of a city was very different from hunting in the wild but, one by one, Caitlyn located the thugs who had invaded her family home. The trail eventually led her to a hidden safehouse, where her mother and father were being tortured for information. She rescued them under cover of darkness, and alerted the Piltover Wardens… though not one of the kidnappers they arrested knew the identity of the individual who had hired them—only a proxy with the initial C .\nCaitlyn and her parents began to rebuild their lives… but something fundamental had changed. Her mother in particular could no longer face the politics and duplicity of clan life, and gave up her prestigious role, leaving something of a vacuum in the Kiramman leadership. And, though she loved her parents dearly, Caitlyn had no desire to take her mother’s place, nor to learn her father’s trade as an artificer.\nInstead, her focus turned toward breaking through the web of intrigue surrounding the mysterious \"C\". Utilizing her hunting skills, she established herself as a private investigator, and quickly made a name for herself as someone who could find anything or anyone. In recognition of her self-made success, Caitlyn’s parents crafted her a hextech rifle of exquisite artifice, with greater accuracy than any musket. The weapon could take a variety of specialized shells, and be easily modified in the field.\nAfter a particularly traumatic case involving a missing hextech device and a series of child abductions, Caitlyn was summoned by the Wardens.\nShe had been recommended by one of their number who had also developed something of an affinity for stranger cases—and their battle with a host of rogue chimerics in the employ of a lunatic chem-researcher driven mad by his own concoctions led to her being offered a formal position as a sheriff. At first, Caitlyn refused, but eventually came to realize that the Wardens’ resources could potentially get her closer to discovering the true identity of “C\".\nCaitlyn has since become a highly respected officer within the ranks of the Wardens, always striving to make the City of Progress a better and safer place. She recently partnered with a new recruit from Zaun, the brash and reckless Vi. How such an unlikely pairing came about—and been proven so effective—is the subject of wild rumor and tavern speculation among their fellow Wardens, as well as those they haul away to jail.\nWhat Caitlyn doesn't know, however, is that \"C\" is also keeping tabs on her... especially as her investigations bring her ever closer to the truth.\nCaitlyn's height is above average, standing 6'1 tall and slim but muscular build with pale skin, back-length dark blue hair, and piercing deep blue eyes. She is part Piltovan and Ionian.\nHer outfit is a combination of white, dark blue, and bronze colors. She consists of a sheriff's uniform with a short navy blue skirt, long navy blue stockings with embellishments and bronze heeled boots and she always wears a matching top hat with the uniform which gives her a classy yet intimidating look.\nCaitlyn is a woman who is very devoted to the community of Piltover. She enjoys her work as a sheriff, where she assists citizens and apprehends criminals while ensuring they have a fair trial, demonstrating that she is fair to both good and bad people.\nShe is strict, disciplined, and level-headed. She will use legal means to ensure that her work is meticulous and routine. These characteristics are what distinguishes her as an effective detective. However, Caitlyn can also be somewhat rebellious, as she has been known to break the rules at times in order to carry out her duty, such as allowing Vi, a woman from Zaun, to join her and chaperone her on missions. There have been rumors that her and Vi's relationship is more than just professional or a friendship.\nCaitlyn has proven to be a very compassionate person after witnessing the state of Zaun; she works together with Vi to protect the city, and prevent the corruption from continuing.\nDespite her maturity and elegance, she is a big fan of Seraphine and will drop all said traits to being giddy and excitable should she be around.\nCaitlyn earned her position as sheriff for her incredible use of firearms, especially in the rifle that is her favorite weapon, she never misses and Vi described her aim as impeccable.\nCaitlyn and Vi are partners-in-law-enforcement. They have been working together for a long time so much that their relationship is speculated to be more than friendship and professional. They've been chasing after Jinx who is Vi's sister and a dangerous criminal who's been wreaking havoc in Piltover. They managed to stop a turmoil caused by Urgot and his followers, caught him and later put him in an isolated island prison. The duo later fight him again when his followers try to free him from his prison."}

Adaptable and precise, she views sloppy technique as an embarrassment that must be put to order. With a mind as sharp as the blades she bears, Camille's pursuit of superiority through hextech body augmentation has made many wonder if she is now more machine than woman.\nMost of the family’s wealth came through harvesting a rare crystal from the brackern, a creature native to Shurima. These hex-crystals—or “first crystals”—contained power normally only wielded by those born with innate magical ability. After Camille’s great-great aunt lost an arm during an early expedition, her sacrifice inspired the Ferros family motto: “For family, will I give.”\nThe brackern were a limited resource, and Camille's family had to augment the crystals they’d accumulated. Utilizing shadow investments in chemtech and runic alchemy, they developed less powerful, but easier to make, synthetic hex-crystals.\nYet there were consequences—synthetic crystal manufacturing has long been rumored to heavily contribute to the Zaun Gray. Furthermore, it was only through espionage, intimidation, and murder that Clan Ferros held its monopoly on this priceless commodity, and ensured its uninterrupted production in Zaun, maintaining the family’s place in Piltover’s illustrious Bluewind Court.\nAs the eldest surviving child of Clan Ferros’ masters, Camille received every educational advantage. She had exceptional tutors, learning to speak several foreign languages and play the cellovinna at a concert-master level. Camille also learned to read and write Ancient Shuriman while assisting her father on digs in the Odyn Valley.\nTraditionally, one of the younger children would become their family's principal intelligencer, working with the clan master to secure their family’s success by any means necessary. However, Camille's younger brother, Stevan, had a weak constitution, and so Camille took his place. He jealously watched her embrace her additional training, and she became quite adept in combat, reconnaissance, and interrogation.\nWhen Camille was twenty-five, augmented Zaunite thugs attacked her and her father, intent on stealing lucrative trade secrets. Camille’s father succumbed to his wounds, and in anguish, her mother died soon after. Stevan became clan master, and he doubled the clan’s research in human hextech augmentation, eager to prove himself as a strong leader.\nAfter a year of mourning, Stevan oversaw the induction of Hakim Naderi—a promising young crystallographer from the Shuriman coastal city of Bel'zhun—as the family’s lead artificer.\nCamille requested hextech augmentation from Hakim to push her beyond her human limitations. Hakim was instantly enamored with her, and they bonded over the preparations and late night stories of Shurima… and eventually, Camille returned Hakim's feelings. Their affair grew reckless, as they knew the surgery would conclude their time together. Hakim would move onto other projects, and Camille would once again be fully committed to the principal intelligencer’s duties. More than that, Hakim worried that in carving away Camille's heart, he might remove her humanity.\nDays before Camille's operation, Hakim proposed marriage and begged her to run away with him. For the first time in her life, Camille was torn.\nStevan had no such conflict, as he needed Camille to execute his vision. When he learned of the secret proposal, he devised a plan—the next time Camille and Hakim were together, Stevan set himself up to be attacked. When she saw her brother bruised and bloodied, Camille recognized what could happen when her attention was divided.\nHakim pleaded with Camille, but she wouldn’t listen. For family, she would give. She ended her relationship with Hakim, insisting her surgery go forward.\nHe was the only one who could safely perform the operation, and so he excised Camille’s heart and replaced it with hextech—then resigned. When she awoke, the lab she and Hakim had shared was abandoned.\nCamille focused on her work. She took on further refinements, including bladed legs, grapple-spindled hips, and other, minor hex-augmentations, leading some to wonder how much of the woman was left. And as Clan Ferros amassed more power and wealth, Camille’s missions became darker and more deadly.\nThanks to her hextech heart, she did not age—but the years were not so kind to her brother. Yet even as Stevan's body grew more frail, his iron grip on the clan remained.\nEventually, Camille uncovered the depth of Stevan's betrayal, and realized his machinations were no longer in the family’s best interests. In that moment, she discarded the last sentiment she felt toward her brother.\nAfter installing her favorite grand-niece as clan master, Camille now runs the family's public affairs as well as its more shady operations. As a solver of… difficult problems , she embraces her more-than-human transformation and the cutting judgment it affords her—but a strange, mournful keening in her hextech heart may yet prove a troubling portent.\nRegardless, Camille refuses to sit idle, and gains invigoration from well-executed industrial espionage, a fresh-brewed cup of tea, and long walks in the Gray.\nDuring the events of Convergence, Camille is entrusted with a mission which is to stop the Poingdestres, a chymobarons family which has carried out illegal and extremely dangerous experiments at the expense of the Hextech crystals of the Ferros clan.\nAfter finding out that Ekko was getting into the Poingdestres' investigation, she herself went to confront him and tell him that the only way to stop him from interfering further was to kill him and the two began to fight.Ekko managed to incapacitate Camille. Future Ekko at that moment telling her that he had met Camille, she immediately deduced that there were two Ekkos, who were trying to stop the Poingdestres chemobarons just like her and proposes that they work together. Future Ekko, upsetting Present Ekko , to which Camille proceeded to leave to find the remaining Poingdestres.\nDuring the fight against Jinx, she was about to throw explosives at Ekko but at that moment Camille appeared and cut the explosives with her legs leaving Jinx very surprised, then Camille proceeded to attack Jinx. At first Jinx took the lead hitting camille on the head, but Ekko used his Z press to rewind that moment to tell Camille to protect her head, then after a few hits she managed to incapacitate Jinx but due to a slight distraction she managed to escape .\nCamille asked Ekko if there was any way to contact his Future Self and Ekko told him that there was a way and to play along, Ekko called his future self and told him that Camille was going to kill him for letting the Poigndestres go, Camille proceeded to pretend to attack him with her blades and Future Ekko appeared at that moment to stop Camille from landing the final blow on Ekko.\nFuture Ekko asked what was happening and realized that he had been set up, Camille proceeded to threaten him to reveal his plan unless he wanted her to get the information out of him herself. Future Ekko said that the only way to avoid the catastrophe was to destroy the reserves of Syntixi and the reserves of Hextech crystals in the Ferros clan vaults at the same time, which horrified Camille and Ekko. Future Ekko subsequently escaped to search for more Syntixi, Ekko asked Camille to go with him to Zaun to try to find Future Ekko's hideout and discover his plan.\nCamille is an elegant-looking woman with beautiful human and robotic features; she is very tall due to having, instead of legs, large prosthetic blades; her hips are exaggeratedly large, housing her grappling lines; her facial features are pale white skin, high cheekbones, thick lips, short platinum white hair, and piercing electric blue eyes. She wears a cyborg armor of black, dark blue and dark gray colors that covers the entirety of her body aside from her face.\nCamille is obsessed with her work, enhancing her body to levels far from a normal human through hextech body augmentations. She's cold and ruthless, not allowing any emotion to interfere with her duties. Being born into one of the most powerful families in Piltover, Camille is an aristocrat with an intense loathing of carelessness and mistakes. The virtues she values most are: Patience and Precision.\nDespite her lack of emotions, Camille can still show signs of empathy and teamwork, even collaborating with Zaunites.\nShe has encountered and fought against Jhin during his assassination mission in Zaun which affected her clan's business. What happened to Camille afterward is still unknown, however."}

Future Ekko said that the only way to avoid the catastrophe was to destroy the reserves of Syntixi and the reserves of Hextech crystals in the Ferros clan vaults at the same time, which horrified Camille and Ekko. Future Ekko subsequently escaped to search for more Syntixi, Ekko asked Camille to go with him to Zaun to try to find Future Ekko's hideout and discover his plan.\nCamille is an elegant-looking woman with beautiful human and robotic features; she is very tall due to having, instead of legs, large prosthetic blades; her hips are exaggeratedly large, housing her grappling lines; her facial features are pale white skin, high cheekbones, thick lips, short platinum white hair, and piercing electric blue eyes. She wears a cyborg armor of black, dark blue and dark gray colors that covers the entirety of her body aside from her face.\nCamille is obsessed with her work, enhancing her body to levels far from a normal human through hextech body augmentations. She's cold and ruthless, not allowing any emotion to interfere with her duties. Being born into one of the most powerful families in Piltover, Camille is an aristocrat with an intense loathing of carelessness and mistakes. The virtues she values most are: Patience and Precision.\nDespite her lack of emotions, Camille can still show signs of empathy and teamwork, even collaborating with Zaunites.\nShe has encountered and fought against Jhin during his assassination mission in Zaun which affected her clan's business. What happened to Camille afterward is still unknown, however."}

Youngest and most beautiful daughter of the noble Du Couteau family of Noxus , she ventured deep into the crypts beneath Shurima in search of ancient power. There, she was bitten by a gruesome tomb guardian, whose venom transformed her into a viper-like predator. Cunning and agile, Cassiopeia now slithers under the veil of night, petrifying her enemies with her baleful gaze.\nBorn as a noble of Noxus , Cassiopeia Du Couteau had a sharp mind and wit at an early age, and very early on in her life the Du Couteau family moved to Urzeris , Shurima . While her older sister Katarina trained under their father Marcus to be an assassin, Cassiopeia was taught by her mother Soreana how to use a position of authority. One day, Soreana fell ill as a result of an assassination attempt through poisoning her hairbrush. With Marcus removing the house staff, Cassiopeia tended to her mother, where the two developed a closer bond as Soreana recovered.\nWhen Marcus and Katarina returned to Noxus, Cassiopeia remained in Urzeris with her mother. Soreana told her the truth that she was part of the Black Rose cult, which had managed to influence Shurima. As Cassiopeia grew to adulthood, Soreana mentored her to be a cunning and manipulative figure who could use those around her as tools before disposing of them when given the chance. Cassiopeia was initiated into the Black Rose by stealthily assassinating those who plotted Soreana's death.\nAfter gaining her role with the Black Rose's plans, Cassiopeia raided Shuriman ruins with the help of a Shuriman mercenary named Sivir . When Soreana received the news that her husband honored Jericho Swain's coup against Boram Darkwill , she realized that the Black Rose would be in danger, so she instructed Cassiopeia to obtain Shurima's godly power. Swearing to her mother's oath, Cassiopeia raided the underground Tomb of the Forgotten with Sivir. She backstabbed Sivir with her dagger before reaching for the artifact, the Chalikar to open the doors to the tomb and gain the God-Warriors' power of Ascension.\nHowever, Cassiopeia was bitten by a stone snake guardian which guarded the tomb, painfully transforming her into a half-human, half-snake hybrid. Falling into despair, Cassiopeia mourned her lost life for weeks, but eventually moved on and accepted her new form, hoping for her newfound Ascended magic to have potential for the Black Rose.\nGetting used to her new form while overlooking Urzeris, Cassiopeia felt an urge to hunt down a Noxian soldier she held contempt for. Lurking out of his view, she admonished him for killing children for drake meat for profit and killing three people while leaving them unrecognizable. Calling out to her to show herself, Cassiopeia revealed her monstrous appearance to him. She wrapped her tail around the soldier, feeling sadistic satisfaction towards his pain. He recognized her as Lady Cassiopeia and taunted her about how she lost her nobility. In response, Cassiopeia released all of her pent-up emotions as she petrified him into stone. Feeling satisfaction that her new cursed form allowed her to take what she wanted, she smashed the petrified soldier as she eagerly plotted to attack her next victim.\nCassiopeia is a slim woman who wears only a Shuriman headdress, bra and armbands on her elbows. After being transformed by her curse, her legs turned into a long green snake tail merged into her body with a golden belt, and her fingers have become golden with an adorned jewel on the back of each hand. She has black sclera with glowing lime irises and slitted pupils. She has snake-like fangs in place of teeth and a forked tongue.\nCassiopeia is a treacherous, manipulative schemer who takes any opportunity she can to further her goals.

Her father and sister supported Swain , which was considered a betrayal by Cassiopeia and her mother.

Rising from humble origins to become the Hand of Noxus, he cleaves through the empire's enemies—many of them Noxians themselves. Knowing that he never doubts his cause is just, and never hesitates once his axe is raised, those who stand against the commander of the Trifarian Legion can expect no mercy.\nBorn in Basilich , Darius was as an orphan alongside his younger brother Draven . He struggled hard to provide for both himself and his brother and protected the latter from anyone who tried to harm him, even the city guard. Darius spent a majority of his childhood fighting for survival, with constant fights leaving permanent scars on himself. He and Draven were friends with a girl named Quilletta Varn , whom saved him from falling off a cliff that they were climbing. Darius developed a relationship with Quilletta, having ambitions to conquer the world alongside her.\nWhen an Noxian army led by their captain Cyrus invaded Basilich, the three children hid atop a rooftop. Quilletta was reluctant towards the harsh choice between joining Noxus or being killed, but Darius contemplated paying the consequences since he didn't want to leave Draven behind. To his horror, Draven attempted to throw a knife to fight them but ended up hitting Cyrus' flag, leading to the three to get apprehended by the soldiers. After hearing Draven's boasts, Cyrus invited the kids to ally with Noxus.\nGrowing to adulthood in Noxus, Darius married Quilletta and became a father to two: Decius and Invetia . He and Draven served as soldiers under Cyrus' warhost, engaging in many war campaigns and stopping rebellions against Boram Darkwill's throne. Darius quickly rose through the ranks, embodying the values of Noxus through his aggression, bravery and patriotism. In one battle, after a general ordered a retreat, Darius saw him as a coward and beheaded him out of defiance, rallying the fearful troops and securing a victory. He was rewarded by being promoted to senior commander, which attracted many Noxians to join his army but he only accepted those with the greatest strength and discipline. Feared to the point where cities surrendered at the sight of Darius' banners, his victory against the Varju got him promoted to the Hand of Noxus by Darkwill himself.\nAs the new Hand of Noxus, Darius and his army were sent to the Freljord to conquer it, enduring countless assassination attempts and a capture from the Winter's Claw before ending in a stalemate after a long, grueling conflict. He headed back to Noxus to request a reconsolidation of the military, but found that Darkwill had been assassinated and usurped by Jericho Swain , as part of his coup which even Draven had backed. Darius began to respect Swain's accomplishments and was prepared to serve him, but he gave Darius a place in the Trifarian Legion , representing the Noxian principle of Might alongside Swain as Vision and the Faceless as Guile. Despite this, not all Noxus military leaders respect him. The most notably is Ambessa Merdada who has low opinions on him as she calls him an arrogant brute with no cunnings.\nDespite his great achievements, his personal life started to suffer as his son, Decius perished in a campaign in Frejolrd much to Quilleta's grief but he was proud of it since his son died for the glory of the Empire. This fact damaged his marriage as Quilleta became isolated from both Darius and her daughter who sided with Darius.\nEventually, Quilletta was starting to become disillusioned towards Noxus after witnessing the horrific aftermath of Singed 's chemical bomb in Ionia, which caused her arm to be amputated as a result of the poison, and their son Decius dying in the campaign against the Freljord. Quilletta expressed her worries to Darius, but he dismissed her saying that Noxus required mercilessness and sacrifice because the empire had to conquer and losing one city would be severely detrimental. Finally having enough, Quilletta snapped from her grief towards Decius' death only to be killed by Invetia, believing her to be weak. Horrified, Darius asked Invetia about her merciless act, and she cited the Noxian philosophy and how she learned it from him.\nDarius is a large, bulky man with a serious, intense face and middle-aged features. He has fair skin and swept-back black hair with a white streak. His eyes are variously portrayed as either red, green or gray. He also has a long, straight scar over his left eye.\nDarius wears heavy full plate armor that leaves only his head and his upper arms exposed. It is dark gray, intricately crafted, and accentuated with spikes around the shoulders and thighs. It also features a long cape and loin cloth, both blood red, symbolizing Noxus.\nHis weapon of choice is a massive two-handed ax, viciously curved and forged with a symbol of a skull where the blade meets the handle.\nStern and warlike, Darius is unwaveringly dedicated to Noxus and its ideals. He is a soldier without parallel, balancing ruthless mettle with sound strategy. He stands confident and firm, showing no tolerance for weakness or cowardice. Despite his intimidating demeanor, however, Darius is also deeply committed to fostering the strength of others wherever he can find it, elevating those he finds deserving and crushing those who have not earned their status.\nDarius was accoladed by Darkwill, but allied with Swain because he sees in the Master Tactician someone who can make Noxus rise.\nIn Darius' eyes necromancy is cheating death to justify one's undeserved continued survival. [ 1 ] Yet for him, Sion's legacy is an example. Though when he gazes upon the Undead Juggernaut, he sees what might become of himself should he no longer be useful to the empire (or rather, too useful, should death come knocking). [ 2 ]\nDarius holds no grudge against Garen . However, he considers him a fool bound by a meaningless code of \"honor.\" Despite this, he would relish killing Garen simply to prove Noxian Might crushes all, even Demacian Perseverance , Courage , and Justice —especially a paragon of said values. [ 3 ]\nDarius and his younger brother Draven are renowned as the \"Blood Brothers.\" Family ties are strong and can serve as the basis for one's strength, yet Darius sees self-serving aristocrats using theirs as a crutch for their weakness, and as a result, the perpetuation of stagnant leadership that needs to be removed and replaced. With this in mind, one cannot tell if Darius providing and caring for Draven during their childhood came out of love or even mere pragmatism. The comic Blood of Noxus seems to imply the former.\nHe has 2 children (Decius and Invetia Varn ) mothered by his former lover, Quilletta Varn . They never married given the pragmatism of Noxus, and knowing the likely trajectory of their lives at war. [ 4 ] Both their children followed their parents's footsteps in the Noxus military but Decius perished in combat, leaving Quilletta in grief. She was murdered by their daughter Invetia during the Battle of Basilich .\nWhile it was never explicitly confirmed that they are his children, it was heavily implied due to the relationship between Darius and Quilletta as well as some localizations using terms indicative of blood relation.\nSeeing the approval of the slaughtering of innocents by Singed and Emystan made Quilletta Varn grow more disillusioned about the empire's ambitions, which led her to rebel against the empire, among the other events of the story.\nDuring a Black Mist attack caused by Viego at The Immortal Bastion , Darius was temporarily possessed and fought Samira before the Mist retreated."}

Darius developed a relationship with Quilletta, having ambitions to conquer the world alongside her.\nWhen an Noxian army led by their captain Cyrus invaded Basilich, the three children hid atop a rooftop. Quilletta was reluctant towards the harsh choice between joining Noxus or being killed, but Darius contemplated paying the consequences since he didn't want to leave Draven behind. To his horror, Draven attempted to throw a knife to fight them but ended up hitting Cyrus' flag, leading to the three to get apprehended by the soldiers. After hearing Draven's boasts, Cyrus invited the kids to ally with Noxus.\nGrowing to adulthood in Noxus, Darius married Quilletta and became a father to two: Decius and Invetia . He and Draven served as soldiers under Cyrus' warhost, engaging in many war campaigns and stopping rebellions against Boram Darkwill's throne. Darius quickly rose through the ranks, embodying the values of Noxus through his aggression, bravery and patriotism. In one battle, after a general ordered a retreat, Darius saw him as a coward and beheaded him out of defiance, rallying the fearful troops and securing a victory. He was rewarded by being promoted to senior commander, which attracted many Noxians to join his army but he only accepted those with the greatest strength and discipline. Feared to the point where cities surrendered at the sight of Darius' banners, his victory against the Varju got him promoted to the Hand of Noxus by Darkwill himself.\nAs the new Hand of Noxus, Darius and his army were sent to the Freljord to conquer it, enduring countless assassination attempts and a capture from the Winter's Claw before ending in a stalemate after a long, grueling conflict. He headed back to Noxus to request a reconsolidation of the military, but found that Darkwill had been assassinated and usurped by Jericho Swain , as part of his coup which even Draven had backed. Darius began to respect Swain's accomplishments and was prepared to serve him, but he gave Darius a place in the Trifarian Legion , representing the Noxian principle of Might alongside Swain as Vision and the Faceless as Guile. Despite this, not all Noxus military leaders respect him. The most notably is Ambessa Merdada who has low opinions on him as she calls him an arrogant brute with no cunnings.\nDespite his great achievements, his personal life started to suffer as his son, Decius perished in a campaign in Frejolrd much to Quilleta's grief but he was proud of it since his son died for the glory of the Empire. This fact damaged his marriage as Quilleta became isolated from both Darius and her daughter who sided with Darius.\nEventually, Quilletta was starting to become disillusioned towards Noxus after witnessing the horrific aftermath of Singed 's chemical bomb in Ionia, which caused her arm to be amputated as a result of the poison, and their son Decius dying in the campaign against the Freljord. Quilletta expressed her worries to Darius, but he dismissed her saying that Noxus required mercilessness and sacrifice because the empire had to conquer and losing one city would be severely detrimental. Finally having enough, Quilletta snapped from her grief towards Decius' death only to be killed by Invetia, believing her to be weak. Horrified, Darius asked Invetia about her merciless act, and she cited the Noxian philosophy and how she learned it from him.\nDarius is a large, bulky man with a serious, intense face and middle-aged features. He has fair skin and swept-back black hair with a white streak. His eyes are variously portrayed as either red, green or gray. He also has a long, straight scar over his left eye.\nDarius wears heavy full plate armor that leaves only his head and his upper arms exposed. It is dark gray, intricately crafted, and accentuated with spikes around the shoulders and thighs. It also features a long cape and loin cloth, both blood red, symbolizing Noxus.\nHis weapon of choice is a massive two-handed ax, viciously curved and forged with a symbol of a skull where the blade meets the handle.\nStern and warlike, Darius is unwaveringly dedicated to Noxus and its ideals. He is a soldier without parallel, balancing ruthless mettle with sound strategy. He stands confident and firm, showing no tolerance for weakness or cowardice. Despite his intimidating demeanor, however, Darius is also deeply committed to fostering the strength of others wherever he can find it, elevating those he finds deserving and crushing those who have not earned their status.\nDarius was accoladed by Darkwill, but allied with Swain because he sees in the Master Tactician someone who can make Noxus rise.\nIn Darius' eyes necromancy is cheating death to justify one's undeserved continued survival. [ 1 ] Yet for him, Sion's legacy is an example. Though when he gazes upon the Undead Juggernaut, he sees what might become of himself should he no longer be useful to the empire (or rather, too useful, should death come knocking). [ 2 ]\nDarius holds no grudge against Garen . However, he considers him a fool bound by a meaningless code of \"honor.\" Despite this, he would relish killing Garen simply to prove Noxian Might crushes all, even Demacian Perseverance , Courage , and Justice —especially a paragon of said values. [ 3 ]\nDarius and his younger brother Draven are renowned as the \"Blood Brothers.\" Family ties are strong and can serve as the basis for one's strength, yet Darius sees self-serving aristocrats using theirs as a crutch for their weakness, and as a result, the perpetuation of stagnant leadership that needs to be removed and replaced. With this in mind, one cannot tell if Darius providing and caring for Draven during their childhood came out of love or even mere pragmatism. The comic Blood of Noxus seems to imply the former.\nHe has 2 children (Decius and Invetia Varn ) mothered by his former lover, Quilletta Varn . They never married given the pragmatism of Noxus, and knowing the likely trajectory of their lives at war. [ 4 ] Both their children followed their parents's footsteps in the Noxus military but Decius perished in combat, leaving Quilletta in grief. She was murdered by their daughter Invetia during the Battle of Basilich .\nWhile it was never explicitly confirmed that they are his children, it was heavily implied due to the relationship between Darius and Quilletta as well as some localizations using terms indicative of blood relation.\nSeeing the approval of the slaughtering of innocents by Singed and Emystan made Quilletta Varn grow more disillusioned about the empire's ambitions, which led her to rebel against the empire, among the other events of the story.\nDuring a Black Mist attack caused by Viego at The Immortal Bastion , Darius was temporarily possessed and fought Samira before the Mist retreated."}

Clad in shimmering armor the color of winter snow at night, she is a living embodiment of the silver moon's power. Imbued with the essence of an Aspect from beyond Targon's towering summit, Diana is no longer wholly human, and struggles to divine her power and purpose in this world.\nThough Diana's true birthplace is unknown, she was found by a group of Solari hunters when they discovered her swaddled between her dead parents, both of whom were distant travelers that were claimed by Mount Targon's cold temperatures. Discovering that the baby was still alive, the hunters quickly brought her into their temple and dedicated her, raising Diana as a member of the Rakkor , also known as the Tribes of the Last Sun.\nLike all in the Solari faith, Diana underwent rigorous physical and religious training as a child. She was determined to understand the ways and traditions of the Solari, trying to piece together the reasoning and logic behind their beliefs in the sun. Diana would spend many nights digging through the temple's libraries, relying on the pale moonlight in the night sky to illuminate the texts. Paradoxically, Diana's pursuit for answers brought more questions than answers, as her teachers' vague and aphoristic replies provided her with nothing.\nWhile continuing her search, Diana began to notice that some tomes had entire chapters torn out of them, with all references to the moon seemingly missing from all Solari texts. Questioning the Solari faith lead to Diana facing harsh punishments by her teachers, who scolded her for her doubt in the sun. At the same time, Diana's troublesome relationship with her own instructors lead to even her own fellow acolytes shunning her, causing Diana to grow cold and bitter against her fellow classmates who considered her a strange outsider.\nAt the age of thirteen, Diana went under the tutelage of priestess Elcinae, who witnessed a massive argument Diana had with a fellow priestess named Nycinde. Despite this, Elcinae saw the potential in Diana's skills in rhetoric and logic and urged her to train her skills in a way that still respects the teachings of the Solari.\nThe next year, Diana questioned her Oratory class instructor Nemyah on why they call the night \" The Darkness \", arguing that the night is not truly dark and instead lit by a gentler, cooler light in the form of the moon. Because of this, Nemyah demanded she held her tongue and punished her for being disruptive. As punishment, Diana had her speaking privileges revoked from the class. Catching news of this, Elcinae wrote to Diana to urge restraint when questioning the logic of the Solari as well as noting that she would talk with her instructor Nemyah about reinstating her speaking privileges in her Oratory class.\nThe day after, Diana's Oratory class discussed the topic of the upcoming Festival of the Nightless Eve, hearing her classmate Sebina's speech about her excitement for her first Nightless Eve. Diana, rightfully annoyed, questioned why she was being punished while the rest of her classmates get to discuss pointless topics such as the festival.\nSurprisingly, a fellow acolyte named Leona , who was known as being the most faithful and dedicated Solari student, volunteered to argue against Sebina by combatting her emotion with a different one. Though it wasn't a very captivating argument, Diana liked her effort nonetheless. On top of that, Leona described the night as somber rather than evil, which quickly caught Diana's attention. Continuing off of Leona's statement, Diana began to ask questions about the darkness and state her criticisms of the upcoming festival, which quickly angered Nemyah.\nA few days later, Leona passed notes with Diana as the two discussed plans to practice Oratory studies together after their Middle Rakkoric instruction class. Diana questioned why she would ask her of all people to help, as she was known to be the class troublemaker, but Leona insisted that she was the most skilled at constructing logical arguments in the class despite her disagreements with their instructors. Along with that, Leona offered to help Diana in return and share some advice of her own if she wanted. Diana, though still suspicious of whether or not this was some kind of joke Leona was trying to play on her, agreed to help since she had no other assignments of her own to work on.\nDiana, not wanting to get Leona in trouble for talking to her, decided not to meet in person and instead the two swapped notes with each other. Despite the fact that Leona was extremely faithful to the Solari, Diana admired her bravery and humbleness by approaching her for help. Leona was one of the first few classmates to ever show her some form of kindness and she liked the idea of having someone to talk to, but she questioned why Leona would continue associating with her.\nOne day, the two swapped notes once more as Diana examined and discussed Leona's arguments for her upcoming presentation, noting that she was definitely improving. However, the two had a slight disagreement on why anything outside of the Sun was considered evil, as Leona was content with accepting it as truth while Diana believed they should dig deeper into the subject. Aside from that, Leona also noticed that Diana hadn't been practicing with her shield and offered to practice with her, which Diana denied as she felt that using a shield was too distracting and weighed her down, noting that she felt well defended as long as she was on Leona's team.\nDuring the presentation, Diana joined in the debate with Leona despite her speaking privileges having been revoked. When her instructor Priestess Nemyah ordered her to be quiet, Diana instead proposed a rebuttal and suggested that not everything belongs to the sun, which was considered blasphemous to the Solari. As punishment, Diana was sentenced to three days of standing in the sun with no shade or water until sunset as a reminder of its merciful judgement.\nBy the third day of her punishment, Diana was resentful but still didn't completely forsake her Solari faith, though she started questioning whether or not sun even loved her at all as a follower. Though she was punished, she thought the debate she had with Leona during her presentation was worth it as that was the closest they'd have to talking together in public. Though the Festival of the Nightless Eve was coming, Diana planned to instead climb and watch the stars at night, as Leona was the only person she would consider going to the festival with. Diana believed that, because of her low social status and after their public debate, she couldn't possibly want to go to the festival with her.\nLeona finally asked Diana if she would attend the Festival of the Nightless Eve with her, but instead told her that she simply won't be attending the festival, which saddened Leona as she questioned why she wouldn't. Diana, resentful from the punishment she endured, accused Leona of simply trying to preach to her, and never seeing her as a real friend. Diana, despite being on the verge of tears, got angry and yelled at Leona as the two got in a very loud, heated argument before being dragged off and reprimanded by Priestess Thalaia, sentenced to scrubbing the floors of the entire temple as punishment. A few days later, Diana came to the realization that Leona wasn't preaching to her, but genuinely wanted Diana to attend the festival as her date, becoming angry with herself for being so foolish.\nOne the night of the festival, Diana snuck out of the temple while the other acolytes prepared and dressed up. Climbing above the temple around the lower peaks of the mountain, Diana found a good resting place and sat there, watching the sky as the sun began to set. Once the night sky appeared, Diana, even though she knew it was against the Solari faith, relished in the light of the moon and the night stars, secretly offering a prayer to the moon.\nAfter her silent prayer, Diana heard Leona calling for her from afar. As she approached her, Diana questioned why Leona was up there with her and not down at the festival and asked if someone sent Leona to bring her back to the temple. Leona shook her head and instead apologized for making her upset and getting them both in trouble. Diana insisted that she had to apologize instead and the two laughed slightly. While staring at each other under the night sky, the two realized that this was the first time they ever spoke in person with nobody else around to watch them.\nDiana offered Leona a spot to sit next to her and the two watched the night sky together, being closer than they ever had before. Diana again asked if she was going to the festival at all as Leona stated she wasn't sure and that it depended on how she felt. As the two watched in silence, Diana laid her head against Leona's shoulder. The two sat there for hours, simply enjoying the view and each other's company. Diana, however, knowing how much the festival meant to her, offered to dance with her back at the temple. Though she expected her to say no, Leona simply stated \"not yet\" and grabbed her hand, leaning in for a loving kiss before travelling down the mountain to the festival. [ 1 ]\nFor years, Leona and Diana remained as incredibly close friends and lovers. Though the two have their differences in their level of faith to the Solari, they continued to love one another as Diana relished in finally having a true friend among her Solari peers.\nMany years later, Diana continued to question her Solari faith, constantly searching for answers beyond their teachings and seeking to unearth ancient secrets that the Solari seemingly kept hidden for generations. One night, Diana discovered a hidden alcove deep inside the mountain and found images depicting golden warriors with imagery of the sun as well as silver-clad warriors with reflective imagery of the moon, providing evidence of an ancient civilization that once praised the moon the same way the Solari praised the sun.\nDiana eagerly raced to share this message with her dear Leona, but she surprisingly reacted harshly and urged Diana to quit her pursuit, warning her of the punishments she'd face for the heresy she unearthed. Diana, having never seen Leona so serious and bleak before, reluctantly promised her that she'd drop the subject. Frustrated, Diana couldn't resist questioning why this discovery was considered heretical against the faith and sought to find out what the Solari were hiding.\nDesperate for answers, Diana decided to sneak out of the temple under the cover of night and ascend Mount Targon itself, hoping to find the answers she seeks at its peak. The climb up the mountain was excruciating, testing her both physically, mentally and even spiritually as she faced vicious trials on her climb. Surprisingly, she found herself able to survive the harsh heights of Mount Targon by focusing on her love for Leona, hoping to find answers that would make the Solari a better, more complete faith.\nOnce Diana arrived at the summit, she was greeted by the brightest, fullest moon she'd ever seen. In a rapturous moment of power, a pillar of moonlight slammed into her body from the skies as she felt the great presence of an Aspect , which has chosen Diana to be its mortal host. As her body bathed in moonlight, Diana saw glimpses of the past in her mind, provided by this Aspect as it slowly took over her consciousness. Through these visions, Diana learned of the Lunari ; a long lost Rakkor faith that were devout followers of the moon rather than the sun.\nOnce the light dissipated, Diana regained control of her own mind and emerged as the new host for the 6 Aspect of the Moon , her once dark hair now gleamed with a bright silver as she found herself clad in silver armor and holding a crescent blade . Diana quickly realized she was not alone in this ascension, as Leona stood at her side in a golden set of armor that reflected her own.\nThough Diana was overjoyed to share this ascension with her lover, Leona instead demanded that the two of them immediately return to the Solari temple and face the judgement of the priests. Diana begged Leona not to, instead urging her to come with her so that the two can face a new future together, to which Leona refused. Their disagreement increased dramatically as the two eventually engaged in swift combat with one another, erupting into a flurry of moonlight and sunfire. Though Diana had her blade at Leona's throat for a moment, she refused to strike the killing blow and instead feared that she was losing herself to the powers of her new Aspect, choosing to flee down the mountain instead. [ 2 ]\nVindicated in her search, Diana decided to confront the Solari for their incorrect teachings, wishing to show them the errors of their ways. As she arrived at the Solari temple, Diana easily pushed back the Ra'Horak guardians and burst into the chambers of the Solari high priests. While Diana explained the discoveries she found and the visions she saw of the Lunari, she was denounced as a heretic, blasphemer and a peddler of false gods, sentencing her to punishment for her heresy. Upon this, Diana felt a rage amplified by the Aspect within and decided to embrace it in a terrible burst of moonlight , instantly obliterating the high priests and many surrounding Solari. Startled by this sudden and uncontrolled display of powers, Diana fled the temple.\nFollowing visions and memories of the Aspect within her, Diana sought to follow these visions as a means to find the answers she had always been looking for, believing that she had a larger purpose beyond the Solari. Though she's still unsure what these visions are leading her to, she remains resolute to seek out her answers no matter the cost.\nOne night, her visions lead her to a dark forest filled with massive, ancient trees and foliage. Having grown up on the mountain ranges of Targon, she had never seen such verdant forests before. After thanking the Aspect of the Moon for her guidance, Diana found overgrown, withered trees up the slopes of some rocky highlands. After passing through these trees, Diana found a circle of towering stones carved with spirals and curving sigils, noticing that each stone had the same moon-shaped rune that appeared on her forehead. Moving to the center of the mysterious structures, Diana drew her crescent blade and knelt down with her head bowed down before sensing the arrival of three terrifying Voidborn .\nDiana brutally and hastily fought the creatures, slashing at their ivory flesh as their bone-white carapaces quickly darkened a deep purple upon exposure to Runeterra's atmosphere. While fighting off the creatures, Diana felt a deep hatred from within her, seeing visions granted by her Aspect that showed a terrible war that was once waged against these monsters. Diana soon unleashed the full might of her Aspect and got lost in visions of a great city that once stood in this forest, summoning a striking beam of moonlight that split the clouds and empowered the stone structures that surrounded her before obliterating the Voidborn and closing the Void Rift that stood nearby.\nAfter that, Diana returned to her normal conscious self and successfully sealed the rift. However, she knew that her work was not finished and went onward to continue her quest in following the Aspect of the Moon. [ 3 ]\nFollowing her visions, Diana seemingly went missing and began travelling across the world, either running from something or following some unknown mission. At some point, Diana fled Targon and travelled to Ionia for unknown reasons. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] While fleeing out of Targon, Diana left behind her crescent-shaped blade on a distant snowy peak around Mount Targon. [ 6 ]\nAt some point, Diana returned to Mount Targon and found a large majority of Lunari followers emerging out of hiding, inspired by her arrival as the new Aspect of the Moon and seeking to fight back the oppressiveness of the Solari.\nWhen a Lunari Shadestalker named 2 Lyra was captured by the Solari, her mentor 5 Cygnus gathered several Lunari warriors to save her including Diana herself. Lyra, having fallen in love with a Solari boy, was able to escape herself and Diana saw the two of them fleeing the Solari soldiers at a cliff known as Dragon's Roost. Unfortunately, Lyra was killed when an arrow struck her in the chest as she tried protecting her Solari lover. At that moment, Diana witnessed the moon eclipse the sun, illuminating the edge of Dragon's Roost and allowing the two to ascend into the heavens, turning them into celestial constellations that depicted their love.\nAs the Solari soldiers headed back to the tribe, Diana saw Leona for the first time in years leading the Solari soldiers. Though she initially held her weapon up as a threat, she slowly lowered it when Leona noticed her from afar, silently agreeing to not fight this day as the two stared at each other longingly before going their separate ways. [ 7 ]\nOver the years, the two would clash with one another in small skirmishes, as Leona continuously tried to convince Diana to let go of her connection to the moon while Diana continued her search for answers through the Aspect's visions. Eventually, the two Aspects prepared to fully face one another in combat. As Diana stood among her Lunari followers, they gave her prayers of protection for the upcoming battle and coated her weapon in 1 Duskpetal Dust . On the day of the battle, Diana raced down the mountain's peak with the intention of catching Leona's attention, drawing her into a position where she'd get the upper-hand. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]\nDiana at some point returned to Targon to look for any trace of the Lunari; on her way she encountered the sentinels of light. Diana volunteers to guide them up Mount Targon. To fight off the threats of the Ruination, the Sentinels recruit new members, which includes Diana , turning her into Sentinel Diana ; she attains a new uniform and a relic sword by Gwen. After the Sentinels take down Viego, every recently recruited Sentinel lays down their Sentinel weapons and cloaks to return to their regular lives.\nDiana is an incredibly slender woman with pale white skin and eyes the color of lavender. Though her hair was initially black as the night sky, it quickly turned into a striking silver color when she ascended as an Aspect Host . Now as an Aspect, Diana bears a glowing white sigil of the Lunari on her forehead which acts a symbol of her celestial powers. As makeup, Diana has striking dark eyeshadow along with black lines that vertically cross her eyes. She dons dark blue clothing with bright silver armor plates on her shoulders, forearms and breastplate. Her entire outfit is adorned with crescent shaped accessories and details that are customary of the Lunari . Diana's signature moonsilver blade is bright silver, crescent shaped and glows a deep ethereal blue when she activates her abilities.\nDiana as a child was a quite rebellious and undisciplined girl since many times she did not obey the rules of the Solari and that led her to isolate herself from everyone, the only person who understood her was Leona whom she always treated with respect, with time the two became best friends and eventually lovers.\nDiana was also quite curious and she was more curious about the moon and the Lunari tribe whom the Solari looked upon with hatred and abhorrence.\nAfter becoming the Aspect of the Moon, Diana tried to convince Leona to leave Mount Targon together. However Leona only wanted to return to the Solari. This disagreement soon turned into a titanic battle. Diana chose to flee rather than strike down her only friend and lover. Diana is driven by the idea that the Solari and Lunari were close once bfore, and could be again. In recent times she has dedicated herself to guiding the Lunari and helping them to move forward.\nBecause she does not fully control her Aspect powers, Diana can cause great destruction when she explodes in anger, which causes her powers and emotions to go out of control.\nDespite their disagreements, Diana and Leona were close friends and lovers growing up on Mount Targon. The two expressed romantic interest during a Festival of the Nightless Eve .\nNami is travelling to Ionia to find Diana and request she conjure a Moonstone, a super-rare stone from a piece of the moon that broke off and embedded in the mountain aeons ago, to save the Marai from being overrun by the Voidborn invading the Guardian's Sea through a dimensional rift.\nAphelios is looking for Diana to find out why she is running.\nDiana met a Celestial being descending from the Astral Grove . Soraka refers to Diana as the Pale-haired Woman/Sable-haired Girl\nDiana joined the Sentinels of Light to stop the threats of resurrected Pantheon who was under the control of Viego ."}

Clad in shimmering armor the color of winter snow at night, she is a living embodiment of the silver moon's power. Imbued with the essence of an Aspect from beyond Targon's towering summit, Diana is no longer wholly human, and struggles to divine her power and purpose in this world.\nThough Diana's true birthplace is unknown, she was found by a group of Solari hunters when they discovered her swaddled between her dead parents, both of whom were distant travelers that were claimed by Mount Targon's cold temperatures. Discovering that the baby was still alive, the hunters quickly brought her into their temple and dedicated her, raising Diana as a member of the Rakkor , also known as the Tribes of the Last Sun.\nLike all in the Solari faith, Diana underwent rigorous physical and religious training as a child. She was determined to understand the ways and traditions of the Solari, trying to piece together the reasoning and logic behind their beliefs in the sun. Diana would spend many nights digging through the temple's libraries, relying on the pale moonlight in the night sky to illuminate the texts. Paradoxically, Diana's pursuit for answers brought more questions than answers, as her teachers' vague and aphoristic replies provided her with nothing.\nWhile continuing her search, Diana began to notice that some tomes had entire chapters torn out of them, with all references to the moon seemingly missing from all Solari texts. Questioning the Solari faith lead to Diana facing harsh punishments by her teachers, who scolded her for her doubt in the sun. At the same time, Diana's troublesome relationship with her own instructors lead to even her own fellow acolytes shunning her, causing Diana to grow cold and bitter against her fellow classmates who considered her a strange outsider.\nAt the age of thirteen, Diana went under the tutelage of priestess Elcinae, who witnessed a massive argument Diana had with a fellow priestess named Nycinde. Despite this, Elcinae saw the potential in Diana's skills in rhetoric and logic and urged her to train her skills in a way that still respects the teachings of the Solari.\nThe next year, Diana questioned her Oratory class instructor Nemyah on why they call the night \" The Darkness \", arguing that the night is not truly dark and instead lit by a gentler, cooler light in the form of the moon. Because of this, Nemyah demanded she held her tongue and punished her for being disruptive. As punishment, Diana had her speaking privileges revoked from the class. Catching news of this, Elcinae wrote to Diana to urge restraint when questioning the logic of the Solari as well as noting that she would talk with her instructor Nemyah about reinstating her speaking privileges in her Oratory class.\nThe day after, Diana's Oratory class discussed the topic of the upcoming Festival of the Nightless Eve, hearing her classmate Sebina's speech about her excitement for her first Nightless Eve. Diana, rightfully annoyed, questioned why she was being punished while the rest of her classmates get to discuss pointless topics such as the festival.\nSurprisingly, a fellow acolyte named Leona , who was known as being the most faithful and dedicated Solari student, volunteered to argue against Sebina by combatting her emotion with a different one. Though it wasn't a very captivating argument, Diana liked her effort nonetheless. On top of that, Leona described the night as somber rather than evil, which quickly caught Diana's attention. Continuing off of Leona's statement, Diana began to ask questions about the darkness and state her criticisms of the upcoming festival, which quickly angered Nemyah.\nA few days later, Leona passed notes with Diana as the two discussed plans to practice Oratory studies together after their Middle Rakkoric instruction class. Diana questioned why she would ask her of all people to help, as she was known to be the class troublemaker, but Leona insisted that she was the most skilled at constructing logical arguments in the class despite her disagreements with their instructors. Along with that, Leona offered to help Diana in return and share some advice of her own if she wanted. Diana, though still suspicious of whether or not this was some kind of joke Leona was trying to play on her, agreed to help since she had no other assignments of her own to work on.\nDiana, not wanting to get Leona in trouble for talking to her, decided not to meet in person and instead the two swapped notes with each other. Despite the fact that Leona was extremely faithful to the Solari, Diana admired her bravery and humbleness by approaching her for help. Leona was one of the first few classmates to ever show her some form of kindness and she liked the idea of having someone to talk to, but she questioned why Leona would continue associating with her.\nOne day, the two swapped notes once more as Diana examined and discussed Leona's arguments for her upcoming presentation, noting that she was definitely improving. However, the two had a slight disagreement on why anything outside of the Sun was considered evil, as Leona was content with accepting it as truth while Diana believed they should dig deeper into the subject. Aside from that, Leona also noticed that Diana hadn't been practicing with her shield and offered to practice with her, which Diana denied as she felt that using a shield was too distracting and weighed her down, noting that she felt well defended as long as she was on Leona's team.\nDuring the presentation, Diana joined in the debate with Leona despite her speaking privileges having been revoked. When her instructor Priestess Nemyah ordered her to be quiet, Diana instead proposed a rebuttal and suggested that not everything belongs to the sun, which was considered blasphemous to the Solari. As punishment, Diana was sentenced to three days of standing in the sun with no shade or water until sunset as a reminder of its merciful judgement.\nBy the third day of her punishment, Diana was resentful but still didn't completely forsake her Solari faith, though she started questioning whether or not sun even loved her at all as a follower. Though she was punished, she thought the debate she had with Leona during her presentation was worth it as that was the closest they'd have to talking together in public. Though the Festival of the Nightless Eve was coming, Diana planned to instead climb and watch the stars at night, as Leona was the only person she would consider going to the festival with. Diana believed that, because of her low social status and after their public debate, she couldn't possibly want to go to the festival with her.\nLeona finally asked Diana if she would attend the Festival of the Nightless Eve with her, but instead told her that she simply won't be attending the festival, which saddened Leona as she questioned why she wouldn't. Diana, resentful from the punishment she endured, accused Leona of simply trying to preach to her, and never seeing her as a real friend. Diana, despite being on the verge of tears, got angry and yelled at Leona as the two got in a very loud, heated argument before being dragged off and reprimanded by Priestess Thalaia, sentenced to scrubbing the floors of the entire temple as punishment. A few days later, Diana came to the realization that Leona wasn't preaching to her, but genuinely wanted Diana to attend the festival as her date, becoming angry with herself for being so foolish.\nOne the night of the festival, Diana snuck out of the temple while the other acolytes prepared and dressed up. Climbing above the temple around the lower peaks of the mountain, Diana found a good resting place and sat there, watching the sky as the sun began to set. Once the night sky appeared, Diana, even though she knew it was against the Solari faith, relished in the light of the moon and the night stars, secretly offering a prayer to the moon.\nAfter her silent prayer, Diana heard Leona calling for her from afar. As she approached her, Diana questioned why Leona was up there with her and not down at the festival and asked if someone sent Leona to bring her back to the temple. Leona shook her head and instead apologized for making her upset and getting them both in trouble. Diana insisted that she had to apologize instead and the two laughed slightly. While staring at each other under the night sky, the two realized that this was the first time they ever spoke in person with nobody else around to watch them.\nDiana offered Leona a spot to sit next to her and the two watched the night sky together, being closer than they ever had before. Diana again asked if she was going to the festival at all as Leona stated she wasn't sure and that it depended on how she felt. As the two watched in silence, Diana laid her head against Leona's shoulder. The two sat there for hours, simply enjoying the view and each other's company. Diana, however, knowing how much the festival meant to her, offered to dance with her back at the temple. Though she expected her to say no, Leona simply stated \"not yet\" and grabbed her hand, leaning in for a loving kiss before travelling down the mountain to the festival. [ 1 ]\nFor years, Leona and Diana remained as incredibly close friends and lovers. Though the two have their differences in their level of faith to the Solari, they continued to love one another as Diana relished in finally having a true friend among her Solari peers.\nMany years later, Diana continued to question her Solari faith, constantly searching for answers beyond their teachings and seeking to unearth ancient secrets that the Solari seemingly kept hidden for generations. One night, Diana discovered a hidden alcove deep inside the mountain and found images depicting golden warriors with imagery of the sun as well as silver-clad warriors with reflective imagery of the moon, providing evidence of an ancient civilization that once praised the moon the same way the Solari praised the sun.\nDiana eagerly raced to share this message with her dear Leona, but she surprisingly reacted harshly and urged Diana to quit her pursuit, warning her of the punishments she'd face for the heresy she unearthed. Diana, having never seen Leona so serious and bleak before, reluctantly promised her that she'd drop the subject. Frustrated, Diana couldn't resist questioning why this discovery was considered heretical against the faith and sought to find out what the Solari were hiding.\nDesperate for answers, Diana decided to sneak out of the temple under the cover of night and ascend Mount Targon itself, hoping to find the answers she seeks at its peak. The climb up the mountain was excruciating, testing her both physically, mentally and even spiritually as she faced vicious trials on her climb. Surprisingly, she found herself able to survive the harsh heights of Mount Targon by focusing on her love for Leona, hoping to find answers that would make the Solari a better, more complete faith.\nOnce Diana arrived at the summit, she was greeted by the brightest, fullest moon she'd ever seen. In a rapturous moment of power, a pillar of moonlight slammed into her body from the skies as she felt the great presence of an Aspect , which has chosen Diana to be its mortal host. As her body bathed in moonlight, Diana saw glimpses of the past in her mind, provided by this Aspect as it slowly took over her consciousness. Through these visions, Diana learned of the Lunari ; a long lost Rakkor faith that were devout followers of the moon rather than the sun.\nOnce the light dissipated, Diana regained control of her own mind and emerged as the new host for the 6 Aspect of the Moon , her once dark hair now gleamed with a bright silver as she found herself clad in silver armor and holding a crescent blade . Diana quickly realized she was not alone in this ascension, as Leona stood at her side in a golden set of armor that reflected her own.\nThough Diana was overjoyed to share this ascension with her lover, Leona instead demanded that the two of them immediately return to the Solari temple and face the judgement of the priests. Diana begged Leona not to, instead urging her to come with her so that the two can face a new future together, to which Leona refused. Their disagreement increased dramatically as the two eventually engaged in swift combat with one another, erupting into a flurry of moonlight and sunfire. Though Diana had her blade at Leona's throat for a moment, she refused to strike the killing blow and instead feared that she was losing herself to the powers of her new Aspect, choosing to flee down the mountain instead. [ 2 ]\nVindicated in her search, Diana decided to confront the Solari for their incorrect teachings, wishing to show them the errors of their ways. As she arrived at the Solari temple, Diana easily pushed back the Ra'Horak guardians and burst into the chambers of the Solari high priests. While Diana explained the discoveries she found and the visions she saw of the Lunari, she was denounced as a heretic, blasphemer and a peddler of false gods, sentencing her to punishment for her heresy. Upon this, Diana felt a rage amplified by the Aspect within and decided to embrace it in a terrible burst of moonlight , instantly obliterating the high priests and many surrounding Solari. Startled by this sudden and uncontrolled display of powers, Diana fled the temple.\nFollowing visions and memories of the Aspect within her, Diana sought to follow these visions as a means to find the answers she had always been looking for, believing that she had a larger purpose beyond the Solari. Though she's still unsure what these visions are leading her to, she remains resolute to seek out her answers no matter the cost.\nOne night, her visions lead her to a dark forest filled with massive, ancient trees and foliage. Having grown up on the mountain ranges of Targon, she had never seen such verdant forests before. After thanking the Aspect of the Moon for her guidance, Diana found overgrown, withered trees up the slopes of some rocky highlands. After passing through these trees, Diana found a circle of towering stones carved with spirals and curving sigils, noticing that each stone had the same moon-shaped rune that appeared on her forehead. Moving to the center of the mysterious structures, Diana drew her crescent blade and knelt down with her head bowed down before sensing the arrival of three terrifying Voidborn .\nDiana brutally and hastily fought the creatures, slashing at their ivory flesh as their bone-white carapaces quickly darkened a deep purple upon exposure to Runeterra's atmosphere. While fighting off the creatures, Diana felt a deep hatred from within her, seeing visions granted by her Aspect that showed a terrible war that was once waged against these monsters. Diana soon unleashed the full might of her Aspect and got lost in visions of a great city that once stood in this forest, summoning a striking beam of moonlight that split the clouds and empowered the stone structures that surrounded her before obliterating the Voidborn and closing the Void Rift that stood nearby.\nAfter that, Diana returned to her normal conscious self and successfully sealed the rift. However, she knew that her work was not finished and went onward to continue her quest in following the Aspect of the Moon. [ 3 ]\nFollowing her visions, Diana seemingly went missing and began travelling across the world, either running from something or following some unknown mission. At some point, Diana fled Targon and travelled to Ionia for unknown reasons. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] While fleeing out of Targon, Diana left behind her crescent-shaped blade on a distant snowy peak around Mount Targon. [ 6 ]\nAt some point, Diana returned to Mount Targon and found a large majority of Lunari followers emerging out of hiding, inspired by her arrival as the new Aspect of the Moon and seeking to fight back the oppressiveness of the Solari.\nWhen a Lunari Shadestalker named 2 Lyra was captured by the Solari, her mentor 5 Cygnus gathered several Lunari warriors to save her including Diana herself. Lyra, having fallen in love with a Solari boy, was able to escape herself and Diana saw the two of them fleeing the Solari soldiers at a cliff known as Dragon's Roost. Unfortunately, Lyra was killed when an arrow struck her in the chest as she tried protecting her Solari lover. At that moment, Diana witnessed the moon eclipse the sun, illuminating the edge of Dragon's Roost and allowing the two to ascend into the heavens, turning them into celestial constellations that depicted their love.\nAs the Solari soldiers headed back to the tribe, Diana saw Leona for the first time in years leading the Solari soldiers. Though she initially held her weapon up as a threat, she slowly lowered it when Leona noticed her from afar, silently agreeing to not fight this day as the two stared at each other longingly before going their separate ways. [ 7 ]\nOver the years, the two would clash with one another in small skirmishes, as Leona continuously tried to convince Diana to let go of her connection to the moon while Diana continued her search for answers through the Aspect's visions. Eventually, the two Aspects prepared to fully face one another in combat. As Diana stood among her Lunari followers, they gave her prayers of protection for the upcoming battle and coated her weapon in 1 Duskpetal Dust . On the day of the battle, Diana raced down the mountain's peak with the intention of catching Leona's attention, drawing her into a position where she'd get the upper-hand. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]\nDiana at some point returned to Targon to look for any trace of the Lunari; on her way she encountered the sentinels of light. Diana volunteers to guide them up Mount Targon. To fight off the threats of the Ruination, the Sentinels recruit new members, which includes Diana , turning her into Sentinel Diana ; she attains a new uniform and a relic sword by Gwen. After the Sentinels take down Viego, every recently recruited Sentinel lays down their Sentinel weapons and cloaks to return to their regular lives.\nDiana is an incredibly slender woman with pale white skin and eyes the color of lavender. Though her hair was initially black as the night sky, it quickly turned into a striking silver color when she ascended as an Aspect Host . Now as an Aspect, Diana bears a glowing white sigil of the Lunari on her forehead which acts a symbol of her celestial powers. As makeup, Diana has striking dark eyeshadow along with black lines that vertically cross her eyes. She dons dark blue clothing with bright silver armor plates on her shoulders, forearms and breastplate. Her entire outfit is adorned with crescent shaped accessories and details that are customary of the Lunari . Diana's signature moonsilver blade is bright silver, crescent shaped and glows a deep ethereal blue when she activates her abilities.\nDiana as a child was a quite rebellious and undisciplined girl since many times she did not obey the rules of the Solari and that led her to isolate herself from everyone, the only person who understood her was Leona whom she always treated with respect, with time the two became best friends and eventually lovers.\nDiana was also quite curious and she was more curious about the moon and the Lunari tribe whom the Solari looked upon with hatred and abhorrence.\nAfter becoming the Aspect of the Moon, Diana tried to convince Leona to leave Mount Targon together. However Leona only wanted to return to the Solari. This disagreement soon turned into a titanic battle. Diana chose to flee rather than strike down her only friend and lover. Diana is driven by the idea that the Solari and Lunari were close once bfore, and could be again. In recent times she has dedicated herself to guiding the Lunari and helping them to move forward.\nBecause she does not fully control her Aspect powers, Diana can cause great destruction when she explodes in anger, which causes her powers and emotions to go out of control.\nDespite their disagreements, Diana and Leona were close friends and lovers growing up on Mount Targon. The two expressed romantic interest during a Festival of the Nightless Eve .\nNami is travelling to Ionia to find Diana and request she conjure a Moonstone, a super-rare stone from a piece of the moon that broke off and embedded in the mountain aeons ago, to save the Marai from being overrun by the Voidborn invading the Guardian's Sea through a dimensional rift.\nAphelios is looking for Diana to find out why she is running.\nDiana met a Celestial being descending from the Astral Grove . Soraka refers to Diana as the Pale-haired Woman/Sable-haired Girl\nDiana joined the Sentinels of Light to stop the threats of resurrected Pantheon who was under the control of Viego ."}

Now a self-proclaimed physician, he was once a patient of Zaun’s most infamous asylum. After “curing” the entire staff, Dr. Mundo established his practice in the empty wards that once treated him and began mimicking the highly unethical procedures he had so often experienced himself. With a full cabinet of medicines and zero medical knowledge, he now makes himself more monstrous with each injection and terrifies the hapless “patients” who wander near his office.\nThe man now known as Dr. Mundo was born and raised in Zaun . He grew up to be a large man, able to physically intimidate others. He had a friendly and good-natured personality and would often use nicknames for people. As an adult, despite his friendly conduct, he worked as henchman and enforcer for a chem-baron .\nAfter making a mistake that infuriated his boss, the chem-baron decided to make an example out of the enforcer. He was committed to Osweld Asylum, where he was experimented on. Suffering through the cruel treatments, the enforcer's body grew muscular than he already was, yet his brain deteriorated. Eventually, he lost all memories of his previous life, including his name and that of his boss. Instead he constructed a new reality from his surroundings, mistaking his restraining jacket for the coat of a doctor, and took on the name and profession Dr. Mundo .\nOver time, Mundo 'treated' everyone in the asylum, killing and dismembering them. When the chem-baron returned to collect his enforcer, Mundo treated him as well, killing him on an operating table. After the man tragically died during the surgery, Dr. Mundo stepped outside for the first time and recognized many potential patients that need to be 'cured'.\nOne day, Dr. Mundo fought Ekko on the Sump Level , who he thought of as a carrier of a virus. After hours, he managed to harm the boy, but the damage was magically reversed and the patient managed to escape. After the fight, Mundo returned to his hospital.\nDr. Mundo is a towering man enhanced by Chemtech medicine and implants.

This is a psychotic delusion/escapist reality, and he often injures, dismembers, or even kills his 'patients' without realizing it. Despite all this, Mundo seems to care for his 'patients,' becoming sad when his 'cures' don't work.

If the target dies or is a small monster, they are sent flying away in a line, though not through terrain, causing all enemies they pass through to take Champions stunned with Pyromania (P) 100% AD plus Blunt Force Trauma's minimum bonus damage.\nBlunt Force Trauma as well as the triggering Successful resurrections with Rebirth (P) attack's damage is increased to 140% against minions and 200% against monsters .\nBlunt Force Trauma resets Dr. Mundo's basic attack timer.\nR - Maximum Dosage: Active: Dr. Mundo injects himself with chemicals to become enhanced for 10 seconds, gaining increased Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) base health , Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R) bonus movement speed , and Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) bonus health regeneration .\nAt rank 3, Maximum Dosage's increased Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) base health and Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) bonus health regeneration are both increased by 5% for each enemy champion within 1200 units at the time of cast.\nLore:\n.\nDr. Mundo Titles Nickname (s) Dr. Mundo Alias (es) The Madman of Zaun Characteristics Species Human ( Chemically Altered ) Pronoun (s) He/Him Timeline Born: 967 AN - 977 AN Weapon (s) Bonesaw Electric Implants 'Medical' bag Personal status Status Alive Place of origin Zaun Current residence Osweld Asylum, Zaun Family Unnamed Mother Pet(s) Raccoon Professional status Occupation (s) 'Doctor' Henchman Region (s) Zaun Champion Dr. Mundo/LoL Related character (s) Ekko\nUtterly mad, tragically homicidal, and horrifyingly purple, Dr. Mundo is what keeps many of Zaun’s citizens indoors on particularly dark nights. Now a self-proclaimed physician, he was once a patient of Zaun’s most infamous asylum. After “curing” the entire staff, Dr. Mundo established his practice in the empty wards that once treated him and began mimicking the highly unethical procedures he had so often experienced himself. With a full cabinet of medicines and zero medical knowledge, he now makes himself more monstrous with each injection and terrifies the hapless “patients” who wander near his office.\nThe man now known as Dr. Mundo was born and raised in Zaun . He grew up to be a large man, able to physically intimidate others. He had a friendly and good-natured personality and would often use nicknames for people. As an adult, despite his friendly conduct, he worked as henchman and enforcer for a chem-baron .\nAfter making a mistake that infuriated his boss, the chem-baron decided to make an example out of the enforcer. He was committed to Osweld Asylum, where he was experimented on. Suffering through the cruel treatments, the enforcer's body grew muscular than he already was, yet his brain deteriorated. Eventually, he lost all memories of his previous life, including his name and that of his boss. Instead he constructed a new reality from his surroundings, mistaking his restraining jacket for the coat of a doctor, and took on the name and profession Dr. Mundo .\nOver time, Mundo 'treated' everyone in the asylum, killing and dismembering them. When the chem-baron returned to collect his enforcer, Mundo treated him as well, killing him on an operating table. After the man tragically died during the surgery, Dr. Mundo stepped outside for the first time and recognized many potential patients that need to be 'cured'.\nOne day, Dr. Mundo fought Ekko on the Sump Level , who he thought of as a carrier of a virus. After hours, he managed to harm the boy, but the damage was magically reversed and the patient managed to escape. After the fight, Mundo returned to his hospital.\nDr. Mundo is a towering man enhanced by Chemtech medicine and implants. His already large body gained even more muscles during his torture at the asylum, which also led to his purple skin and blue tongue. He currently wears a ragged restraining jacket, even though it is much too small for his figure.\nMundo believes himself to be a doctor and everyone else to be his patients. This is a psychotic delusion/escapist reality, and he often injures, dismembers, or even kills his 'patients' without realizing it. Despite all this, Mundo seems to care for his 'patients,' becoming sad when his 'cures' don't work. He works tirelessly to cure these people of these supposed 'diseases' and is a generally caring but crazy person.\nDr. Mundo fought against Ekko in the Sump level . However, he only perceived him as 'patient' in need of 'treatment', and it is unclear Mundo even remembers him."}

Using his own invention, the Z-Drive , he explores the branching possibilities of reality to craft the perfect moment. Though he revels in this freedom, when there’s a threat to his friends, he’ll do anything to defend them. To outsiders, Ekko seems to achieve the impossible the first time, every time.\nBorn to Inna and Wyeth who envisioned a brighter future for their son in Piltover , Ekko grew up watching his parents age beyond their years, toiling for too many hours under dangerous conditions in suffocating factories. They believed, it would all be worth it,  if it meant their son could one day rise to the city above.\nWhile his parents saw only pollution and crime of Zaun , Ekko recognized the vibrant energy and potential for innovation that thrived amidst the city's chaos. This appreciation for Zaun's resilience and resourcefulness fueled Ekko's youth, leading him to form bonds with the scrappy orphans of Zaun, known as the Lost Children of Zaun .\nSurrounded by the ingenuity of Zaunites and inspired by their ability to thrive in adverse conditions, Ekko's childhood was marked by wild invention and exploration. From constructing simple machines before he could crawl to embarking on escapades through the labyrinthine streets, Ekko embraced the spirit of his city and its people.\nDuring a solo trek into the rubble of a recently demolished laboratory, Ekko stumbles upon a shard of hextech crystal that would change the course of his life forever. He scrambled to find more pieces, but the encroaching enforcers told him he wasn’t the only one looking. Ekko barely escaped, and returned to his home.\nEkko's discovery of the hextech shard set him on a path of experimentation. With relentless determination, he worked to harness the shard's temporal powers, culminating in the creation of the Zero Drive—a device capable of manipulating time in small increments. Despite initial setbacks and the creation of multiple versions of himself due to a temporal distortion, Ekko persevered, refining the Zero Drive and pushing its limits.\nOn his name day, Ekko put the Zero Drive to the test, using it to save a friend from a perilous fall. It showed Ekko the potential of his invention and solidified his role as a protector of his friends and city.\nAs Ekko continued to refine his time-bending abilities, he earned a reputation among the youth of Zaun as a hero capable of defying danger. With each trial and error, the Zero Drive grew more stable, allowing Ekko to protect his friends with increasing precision. Despite the physical toll of repeated use, Ekko embraced his role as the defender of Zaun's youth, inspiring others to challenge the status quo and dream of a better future.\nEkko's mastery over time has garnered him attention from the most inventive and formidable figures in both Zaun and Piltover, making him a potential obstacle to their endeavors. Soon Ekko started to be targeted by the worst of them.\nFuture Ekko time warps through the Multiverse.\nIn a possible future, Ekko becomes more enraptured in his technology, neglecting his loved ones. He would use his Zero Drive to rewind situations with his friends and family to get the optimal outcome. He eventually drifts away from all his friends and seldom returns home to see his parents. The Poingdestre Chembaron family would greatly increase their Syntixi manufacturing, much to the ire of Clan Ferros, causing Piltover to increase their chemical dumpings into Zaun. The increased pollution would strengthen the noxious Zaun Grey, causing a city-wide quarantine to be put in place. In retaliation, the Poingdestres would launch attacks against Piltover. Ekko would do his best to save lives on both sides, but to little success. With the cities on the brink of civil war and the pollution forcing his parents to leave Zaun, Ekko resolved to improve his technology to allow to travel further back in time to stop the war.\nAfter numerous failed attempts, Ekko is able to turn his Zero Drive into the Chronoport, but at the expense of his last Zero Drive.

Using his own invention, the Z-Drive , he explores the branching possibilities of reality to craft the perfect moment. Though he revels in this freedom, when there’s a threat to his friends, he’ll do anything to defend them. To outsiders, Ekko seems to achieve the impossible the first time, every time.\nBorn to Inna and Wyeth who envisioned a brighter future for their son in Piltover , Ekko grew up watching his parents age beyond their years, toiling for too many hours under dangerous conditions in suffocating factories. They believed, it would all be worth it,  if it meant their son could one day rise to the city above.\nWhile his parents saw only pollution and crime of Zaun , Ekko recognized the vibrant energy and potential for innovation that thrived amidst the city's chaos. This appreciation for Zaun's resilience and resourcefulness fueled Ekko's youth, leading him to form bonds with the scrappy orphans of Zaun, known as the Lost Children of Zaun .\nSurrounded by the ingenuity of Zaunites and inspired by their ability to thrive in adverse conditions, Ekko's childhood was marked by wild invention and exploration. From constructing simple machines before he could crawl to embarking on escapades through the labyrinthine streets, Ekko embraced the spirit of his city and its people.\nDuring a solo trek into the rubble of a recently demolished laboratory, Ekko stumbles upon a shard of hextech crystal that would change the course of his life forever. He scrambled to find more pieces, but the encroaching enforcers told him he wasn’t the only one looking. Ekko barely escaped, and returned to his home.\nEkko's discovery of the hextech shard set him on a path of experimentation. With relentless determination, he worked to harness the shard's temporal powers, culminating in the creation of the Zero Drive—a device capable of manipulating time in small increments. Despite initial setbacks and the creation of multiple versions of himself due to a temporal distortion, Ekko persevered, refining the Zero Drive and pushing its limits.\nOn his name day, Ekko put the Zero Drive to the test, using it to save a friend from a perilous fall. It showed Ekko the potential of his invention and solidified his role as a protector of his friends and city.\nAs Ekko continued to refine his time-bending abilities, he earned a reputation among the youth of Zaun as a hero capable of defying danger. With each trial and error, the Zero Drive grew more stable, allowing Ekko to protect his friends with increasing precision. Despite the physical toll of repeated use, Ekko embraced his role as the defender of Zaun's youth, inspiring others to challenge the status quo and dream of a better future.\nEkko's mastery over time has garnered him attention from the most inventive and formidable figures in both Zaun and Piltover, making him a potential obstacle to their endeavors. Soon Ekko started to be targeted by the worst of them.\nFuture Ekko time warps through the Multiverse.\nIn a possible future, Ekko becomes more enraptured in his technology, neglecting his loved ones. He would use his Zero Drive to rewind situations with his friends and family to get the optimal outcome. He eventually drifts away from all his friends and seldom returns home to see his parents. The Poingdestre Chembaron family would greatly increase their Syntixi manufacturing, much to the ire of Clan Ferros, causing Piltover to increase their chemical dumpings into Zaun. The increased pollution would strengthen the noxious Zaun Grey, causing a city-wide quarantine to be put in place. In retaliation, the Poingdestres would launch attacks against Piltover. Ekko would do his best to save lives on both sides, but to little success. With the cities on the brink of civil war and the pollution forcing his parents to leave Zaun, Ekko resolved to improve his technology to allow to travel further back in time to stop the war.\nAfter numerous failed attempts, Ekko is able to turn his Zero Drive into the Chronoport, but at the expense of his last Zero Drive. With his last chance, he travels back to stop Clan Ferros from hiring the Poingdestres to manufacture artificial Hextech, but arrives too late. Despite Syntixi being discovered, Future Ekko decides to round it all up before the Poingdestres amass to much power and recruits his younger self to aid him. After the two Ekkos gather all the Syntixi, Future Ekko plans to create a Syntixi bomb and detonate it at the half way point between Piltover and Zaun, not only to destroy the Syntixi but also Clan Ferros' Hextech vault, rendering both cities powerless and averting civil war.

However, despite her beauty, Elise was a proud and ambitious woman, as she only wanted to expand her influence and wealth further.

His courage and bravado knowing no bounds, he prefers to improvise his way out of any situation, relying partially on his wits, but mostly on his mystical Shuriman gauntlet, which he uses to unleash devastating arcane blasts . One thing is for sure—whenever Ezreal is around, trouble isn’t too far behind. Or ahead. Probably everywhere.\nEzreal was born and raised in a wealthy neighborhood of Piltover as the son of two renowned archeologists. As explorers, Ezreal's parents were often away for extended periods of time on expeditions while Ezreal was taken care of by his uncle, Professor Lymere. Becoming used to his parents' absence, Ezreal loved hearing the stories his parents would tell him of their adventures, often fantasizing about joining them on their travels. Ezreal's father would typically tell him the stories of their travels, eventually sharing his plans for an incredibly secretive and ambitious expedition. Ezreal's father sought out the Tomb of Ne'Zuk , a Shuriman tyrant rumored to have the ability to jump from one place to another. He would often joke to the young Ezreal that, if he learned Ne'Zuk's teleportation magic, he would use it to continue his travels and jump back into Piltover in time for dinner.\nProfessor Lymere had trouble raising Ezreal, who was an unruly and rash child, often being tutored on various subjects just to keep him busy and out of trouble. These subjects included advanced cartography, Hextech mechanics and ancient histories of Runeterra , which Ezreal found extremely easy to grasp thanks to his prodigal skill in learning. Seeing studying as a waste of time, he often passed all assessments easily with little or no preparation, infuriating his uncle as he had more free time to roam the university grounds. Being a troublemaker, Ezreal often spent time evading campus wardens, navigating tunnels underneath lecture halls and even practicing lockpicking to sneak into his teachers' offices and rearrange their belongings.\nAs Ezreal grew older, the absences of his parents became longer to the point where they simply didn't return home one day. At that point, Ezreal's uncle tearfully admitted that the two had most likely died somewhere in the Shuriman desert, which Ezreal simply couldn't accept. Having heard of all the preparations and studies his parents would make for these expeditions, Ezreal was still convinced that his parents were still out there somewhere. Ezreal decided he'd find his parents on his own as he planned to search the location of their most important expedition; the Tomb of Ne'Zuk. In preparation, Ezreal abandoned his studies and gathered supplies from the university such as celestial diagrams, runic sigil translations, guides on the burial rites of Shurima and even a pair of protective goggles. Leaving a farewell note for his uncle, Ezreal snuck onto a supply ship heading towards the Shuriman city of Nashramae . The ship's captain discovered Ezreal as a stowaway and threatened to throw Ezreal overboard before he convinced them otherwise by agreeing to act as their navigator, as the previous navigator was unfortunately lost at sea.\nIn Shurima, Ezreal followed his mother's meticulous field notes and crossed the The Great Sai with merchant caravans. For months, Ezreal explored the most ancient Shuriman locations as he delved into cavernous ruins beneath the sands and faced unspeakable horrors that guarded hidden chambers, imagining himself as following his parents' path as an adventurer.\nThe left gauntlet of Ne'Zuk, which Ezreal found within the lost tomb .\nFinally, Ezreal found the tomb of Ne'Zuk underneath a mausoleum for some unnamed emperor, achieving what his parents unfortunately couldn't. The sarcophagus in the tomb however was empty, save for a gleaming bronze gauntlet with a crystalline matrix at its center. As soon as Ezreal touched it, the tomb began to turn on him, activating various thousand year old traps and wards. Improvising and thinking on instinct, Ezreal used the gauntlet and shot out a powerful blast of arcane energy to create a hole for him to exit through. He then teleported instantly to the hidden entrance right before the entire tomb collapsed into sand.\nHaving barely escaped, Ezreal looked down at the mysterious gauntlet as it hummed in-sync with his heartbeat, feeling it siphoning and amplifying his own magical essence. After some investigation, Ezreal discovered that the gauntlet was a fearsome weapon belonging to an Ascended God-Warrior , which he saw as perfect for an explorer like himself.\nHaving found the mystical gauntlet in Ne'Zuk's now collapsed tomb, Ezreal soon returned to Piltover and continued to go on various adventures and expeditions. Ezreal travelled to lost cities, mystical temples and other ancient locations that university professors would only read about on maps, slowly growing his reputation as a treasure-seeking explorer as many would begin telling stories of his exploits, which Ezreal usually saw as incapable of conveying the true scope and scale of his feats. Ezreal chased fame and glory throughout all parts of the world to create a name for himself, but he still hoped that his parents would one day catch word of his grand explorations and eventually seek him out in person.\nIn order to become an officially renowned explorer, Ezreal desperately sought to join the esteemed Piltover Explorers Guild, a widespread organization consisting of Runeterra's best explorers and adventurers. However, Ezreal would be denied entry into the Explorers Guild for currently unknown reasons, angering Ezreal since he believed he was more than qualified to join because of all the dangerous adventures he'd already gone on, and even seeking full acreditation on the guild in exchange for artifact retrieval jobs, like the time he was hired by Januk, a freljordian explorer member of the guild in such way.\nFollowing Professor Lymere's theories about Zaun's ancient history as a Shuriman port city once called Oshra Va'Zaun, Ezreal realized that his uncle had no proof for his theories and decided to search the deepest parts of Zaun to find proof and take credit. [ 1 ] Eventually, Ezreal would discover stories about the Vault of Resplendent Hollies , an ancient and renowned Shuriman vault believed to be full of artifacts and lost temples. [ 2 ] Ezreal eventually learned from a few sources that industrial excavations in Zaun have opened up a crack in the deepest and flooded depths of the Sump layer of Zaun, which he delved into in search of the vault.\nEzreal discovering the doors to the Vault of Resplendent Holies beneath Zaun's Sump\nAs Ezreal began to lose morale over finding nothing within the depths, he managed to find an ancient door most likely to the Vault of Resplendent Holies. The door was lined with various Shuriman glyphs, including a few that resembled owls, which Ezreal deciphered as a warning about a curse that 'multiplies' into a thousand curses, though his Shuriman was candid and rusty. Unable to unlock the door, Ezreal shot a blast of arcane magic through it, creating a hole for him to enter.\nEzreal hiding from fiery Golems within the vault.\nOnce inside the vault, Ezreal found various relics such as one that belonged to Carikkan, the Shuriman emperor's personal spirit-banisher who bound troublesome entities to inanimate objects for his own dark purposes. While rummaging through Carikkan's many relics, Ezreal encountered an army of fiery stone-warrior Golems that defended Carikkan's artifats, which he easily obliterated with shots of arcane energy. Another artifact that Ezreal found was a perfectly preserved golden stele inscribed with the legend of the \"Day of Fire\" and Carikkan's oath to protect Oshra Va'Zaun.\nAfter defeating more fiery Golems, a rush of water started to flood in through the cracks of the floor, forcing Ezreal to swim through tunnels to reach the surface again while carrying the golden stele. Managing to escape, Ezreal traveled back to Piltover and visited Zaile's , an outfitter store where Ezreal intended to get his jacket, now torn to shreds, tailored and repaired. Ezreal intended to look as good as possible so that he can impress the Explorers Guild by presenting his journal recording his explorations within the Vault of Resplendent Holies.\nEzreal preparing to fire a blast of energy at the swarm of locusts he acidentally unleashed.\nWhile getting his jacket tailored at Zaile's, Ezreal left the golden stele by a window, causing it to come in contact with direct sunlight during an equinox. The stele began to glow and speak in an ancient language before exploding into a swarm of infernal locust creatures. As more locusts began to pour out of the sewer grates, Ezreal helped clear them out by using blasts from his gauntlet. A few days later, Ezreal faced legal repercussions for bringing the dangerous artifact into Piltover and causing property damage to the mercantile district. Though he sought legal advice and read up on Piltover's libel and slander laws, he ultimately decided to represent himself in court. In order to prove his innocence however, Ezreal quickly logged a possibly false log on his journal to act as evidence, which directly stated that he had nothing to do with the outbreak and blamed the clerk at Zaile's for placing the stele in the sunlight. [ 1 ]\nEzreal continued his adventurous expeditions across the world, writing them in his field notes to record his endeavors and impress the Explorers Guild so they can grant him membership:\nEzreal first traveled southwest of Piltover to the city of Bel'zhun, located in northern Shurima and occupied by Noxian rule. Ezreal knew that the best guides in Shurima were found in the coastal city and found Kasdjar, a knowledgeable and charismatic guide who shared many details about the ancient histories of Shurima as they travelled.\nThe two traveled through the desert together, at some point going to the ancient city of Nerimazeth . While scouring the ruins for priceless artifacts, Kasdjar shared many historical facts about the lands outside of the city, noting that they were once home to the first prototype Sun Disc before it failed and collapsed. Towards the south of Sai Kahleek , Ezreal encountered many Xer'Sai creatures, defending him and his guide by using the magic of his gauntlet. The two took shelter in a circular cavern, which Kasdjar quickly realized was a gargantuan Xer'Sai burrow and the lair of the Sand Mother as the two quickly left as soon as they could. At some point, Kasdjar was tragically killed when a massive obelisk fell on him. Despite this, Ezreal continued his adventure down south reached the edge of Icathia , which he immediately saw as way too dangerous and turned around instantly.\nAt some point, Ezreal sailed out of the Shuriman jungles and shipwrecked on a deserted island home to mysterious, albeit aggressively flirtatious walrus-esque beings. After about a week, Ezreal repaired his ship and sailed back to the main land.\nIn the Noxian capital city, Ezreal once planned to meet a new, mysterious contact to collect archival materials. While waiting for her, Ezreal strolled the promenades surrounding the Immortal Bastion , sampling Noxian cuisine, notably their tacos, and inspecting he monoliths of dark magic that made up the fortress. Ezreal's contact never showed, but he noticed many spies following him until one of them handed him a rose petal colored black . Now sensing danger, Ezreal decided to leave the city and found black petals every day until he left the border, even finding one in his satchel.\nIn the Demacian city of Jandelle , Ezreal searched for a pair of masks supposedly belonging to the Kindred themselves, having been carved out of a bewitched eldlock tree. While searching though, Ezreal began to reminisce on an old tale about a famous Demacian actress who died on stage while playing the dual role of Kindred. Though the masks she wore for that role mysteriously disappeared, Ezreal theorized that these were the original masks of the Kindred and believed they were most likely locked away in a collector's show room.\nWhile staying in Demacia, Ezreal took on the alias of Jarro Lightfeather , a fake identity of a Sentinel of Light who was born in Vaskasia . While taking on the name of Jarro Lightfeather, Ezreal met various Demacians and became a renowned and seemingly infamous national hero.\nAt the eastern parts of Rakelstake in the Freljord, Ezreal encountered the Avarosans and procured a silver totem at the top of a freezing mountain. After that, Ezreal faced trouble with the tribe and fled as quickly as possible, denying any claims that he was ever in the Freljord to the Avarosans.\nWhile sailing around the oceans east of Mount Targon , Ezreal took in the beauty of the Targonian night sky. At the same time however, Ezreal helped quell a mutiny that occurred on the ship he had stowed away on.\nIn Bilgewater , Ezreal studied the local Buhru culture on the Blue Flame Isles , which he knew as the Serpent Isles , and came to learn that their religion predates everything found on both Valoran and Shurima. Having joined in on the festive ceremonies of the Buhru, Ezreal caught sight of Illaoi , curiously examining the massive idol she carried on her.\nAt the southern parts of the Renek River , Ezreal faced off against the eight tribes of the Southern Dune Wanderers, who chased him through the mountains for stealing their sacred medallion. While running though, Ezreal found a rock with a shimmering gap in it, opening up a portal to Bandle City before vanishing. Though Ezreal camped out for a week to see it again, it never reappeared and Ezreal convinced himself it may have been a hallucination.\nIn Mudtown , Ezreal got captured by a gang of marauders who took his gauntlet and possibly other belongings. However, after playing a game of Krakenhand with the gang, Ezreal quickly befriended the gang members and proved his worth to them. Despite not knowing how to play whatsoever, Ezreal managed to win his gauntlet back along with an antique flintlock. [ 2 ]\nEzreal, wanting to once again apply for membership in the Explorers Guild, reunited with Januk, a Freljordian explorer known for illegally raiding museums, and with whom the explorer had already worked before, albeit in uneasy terms as they constantly betrayed one another on their adventures. One instance of such betrayals was when Januk, as payback for the time Ezreal ran off with an important map, purposefully blew Ezreal's cover after they salvaged the wreck of a ship called the Echelon Dawn, which in turn prompted Ezreal to leave him behind on a noxian prision camp. Despite this, Ezreal agreed to do a job for him; find the mythical Elixir of Uloa, a potion sought out by many cults and believed to imbue people with immortality upon consumption. In return, Januk agreed to pay Ezreal sixty thousand, along with full accreditation in the guild. [ 3 ]\nSearching for the elixir in the Shuriman jungles, Ezreal arrived in the village of Paretha . While staying at the village, Ezreal traveled to the Vale of Silver Mist , a magical part of the jungles outside of Paretha. After drinking some taffa-flower water he found in the jungle, Ezreal found what appeared to be an exact copy of himself curiously peering at him from behind a tree, which he choked up to hallucinations from drinking the flower water. [ 2 ]\nEzreal discovering a mysterious temple in Paretha , which housed the Elixir of Uloa.\nAfter a few hours in the jungles, Ezreal found an underground crypt and entered it, easily traversing the many labyrinthine tunnels and traps until he reached a room with the Elixir of Uloa sitting on top of a pedestal. Anticipating more traps to activate if he approaches the vial, Ezreal carefully stepped towards it and lightly grasped the elixir, causing hundreds of sharp stakes to drop, which he narrowly escaped by teleporting away at the last second. Noticing the tomb's supports begin to fall apart, Ezreal quickly traversed back the way he came, escaping the chamber as the floors began to crack and split. Giant insects with large pincers and red eyes began to crawl through the collapsed walls, attacking Ezreal as he defended himself with a few blasts from his gauntlet. As Ezreal slid towards the exit, the chamber suddenly fell apart right in front of him and closed off his only exit out of the crypt. Just in type though, Ezreal blasted a hole through the collapsed chamber with his magical gauntlet and left with the Elixir of Uloa in hand while the tomb's entrance began to cave in completely. [ 4 ]\nWith the elixir in his possession, Ezreal stayed in Paretha to gather supplies. A tribal shaman of the village claimed that Ezreal's soul was entwined with the Aspect of the Wanderer, which confused Ezreal as he didn't think the shaman looked Targonian. Not wishing to face the citizens of Paretha when they realize he caused the collapse of their ancient temple, Ezreal quickly left and began travelling back to Januk to deliver the elixir. [ 2 ]\nMeeting with Jaunk, Ezreal described the feats he pulled when trying to achieve the elixir but refused to give it without the proper payment. Though Januk offered him his payment in money, Ezreal added that he wanted full accreditation within the Explorers Guild as well, which Januk didn't wanna comply with since the Guild weren't very fond of Ezreal and neither was Januk. When Ezreal threatened to give the elixir to a different buyer, Januk laughed it off and went to his office to grab a letter that can grant Ezreal full accreditation in the guild, which Ezreal easily realized was a potential betrayal about to happen. While examining a peculiar bell in Januk's collection, Ezreal heard him state that the bell had Ochnun written on it; the language of the dead. Turning around to face Januk, Ezreal saw him pointing two flintlock pistols at his head.\nEzreal and an angry Januk pointing his flintlock pistols.\nJanuk stated that Ezreal's application to the guild has been denied and revealed that he's part of a cult that sought to use the elixir to raise a fallen dreadlord from the dead. Dodging the gunshots with his teleportation magic, Januk grabbed Ezreal by the gauntlet and tossed him to the floor before kicking his ribs and snagging the elixir out of his grip. After proudly drinking it, Ezreal revealed that the elixir he just drank was actually a bottle of sand wasp venom; a very potent laxative. As he pulled out the true elixir, Januk groaned and collapsed on the floor while Ezreal quickly grabbed the Ochnun bell and leapt out of Januk's office window, hoping to bring the bell back to the Explorers Guild as a way to earn membership. [ 3 ]\nKai'Sa and Ezreal fighting off a swarm of Voidlings together.\nOn a recent expedition to Shurima, Ezreal managed to locate an ancient temple holding the legendary artifact known as the Tear of the Goddess . After removing the magical gem from its base, the temple triggered a mechanism that released a swarm of Voidling creatures from the ground and slowly sealed the temple entrance. Just as the door closed and the swarm closed in, Kai'Sa flew down and blasted a bunch of Voidlings and a hole through the closed entrance. Kai'Sa continued fighting off the swarm while Ezreal had a chance to run off with the gemstone. However, Ezreal hesitated and noticed Kai'Sa getting overwhelmed by the amount of Voidlings, dropping the gem and firing an arcane blast at the creatures before teleporting at Kai'Sa's side. The two fought alongside each other and cleared out most of the swarm as they quickly rushed towards the exit, managing to escape and eventually part ways. [ 5 ]\nEzreal is a young slim pale skinned man with tousled blonde hair and blue eyes.\nHe wears a small brown leather jacket, sometimes undersized so it barely reaches his waist, and some others a more regular sized one. In some versions of the jacket, the collar has a deep-blue furry lining, while in others the jacket has a hood in which the lining is shorter and more wooly-looking, but of a similar color.  Both of his sleeves are rolled up, exposing his forearms. Underneath the jacket. he wears a white shirt with a low V-neck which is adorned with brown colored diamond motives. Since its sleeves can't be seen on his arms, it is either a short-sleeved t-shirt or a tank top. On his left hand he wears an oversized bronze colored (depicted usually more yellowish) glove shaped Shuriman artifact known as the Gauntlet of Ne'Zuk. On his right hand he wears a fingerless glove, probably made from some kind of leather too.\nHe also wears dark high boots and skinny jeans with a pair of belts: one for the jeans themselves and another with several pockets. He wears a secondary thigh belt with an extra pocket in his right leg and has both knees protected by brown colored pads sewed into the jeans.\nHis most distinctive physical feature is the pair of triangular-shaped light blue colored marks appearing right on his cheekbones, products of magic expression in his body that glow brighter when he channels magical energy. [ 6 ] He also wears a pair of protective glasses, either tightened into his head or  hanging from his neck.\nEzreal is an intelligent and cunning young man that appears to be an arrogant, and narcissistic person. He also seems to be a very self-confident individual, always getting into trouble and not being very careful of traps and monsters he encounters as he explores, not caring about the 'collateral damage' he might incur in when exploring. [ 7 ]\nAs stated in his biography, at least part of his attention-seeking behavior comes from a young age. Back when he was kid attending university at petition of his uncle, he was already known for his troublemaking behavior, lockpicking into restricted areas, evading the university wardens, rearranging the professors desks, and even for more infamous and notoriously complex pranks. [ 8 ] Even in his shenanigans as explorer, not taking into account any rules or legal proceedings to do things, all in hopes of his parents being out there and coming back to him if he makes enough of a reputation as an explorer.\nDespite showing this ego-inflated attitude, Ezreal is a wounded inside individual that uses this confident exterior to cover trauma he wouldn't admit having. [ 7 ] [ 9 ] He is a very critical individual of the people and city he grew up in , because he sees his own flaws exaggerated in them. [ 9 ]\nHe has a rather evident image problem, dissonant with his exterior self-centered attitude, Ezreal appears to not stand looking to his reflection in a mirror. [ 9 ]\nEzreal's parents were renown archaeologists of Piltover who, due to their expeditions and adventures outside of Piltover, would often leave Ezreal under the care of his uncle Professor Lymere. Despite their absences, they had a very clear love for their son and kept a good relationship with him on the short occasions that they'd return home to see him.\nEzreal's father would often tell him of their many adventures in the form of stories that amazed the young boy, sparking his initial interest in adventuring and following in his parents' footsteps. Ezreal initially heard the story of Ne'Zuk from his father, who often described it as being his most ambitiously planned expedition as he joked to learn Ne'Zuk's teleportation magic so that he can instantly teleport back home after an adventure.\nEzreal's mother was a talented navigator and the one who wrote meticulous field notes that Ezreal eventually used to help him navigate Shurima when he initially searched for the Tomb of Ne'Zuk.\nAfter their sudden disappearence, their fates remain unknown despite Ezreal's uncle believing that they most likely died on their adventure. However, Ezreal simply refuses to believe that and constantly copes with the idea that they'll eventually return. To this day, Ezreal continues to create a name for himself as a famous explorer with the intent of making sure his parents catch word of their son's grand feats, hopefully convincing them to return home finally.\nProfessor Lymere is Ezreal's uncle and the one who primarily took care of him while growing up due to the absence of his parents. Due to Ezreal's troublesome nature as a child, the two had a rocky and tumultuous relationship. In order to occupy the boy and keep him from causing trouble, Professor Lymere enrolled him into college level courses, which proved ineffective due to Ezreal's incredible ability to absorb and retain knowledge. Freeing up his time from his uncle's classes, Ezreal would continue to cause mischief on the university campus, often angering Professor Lymere.\nTo this day the two stay in touch and, despite their turbulent relationship, Ezreal seems to share some respect for his uncle as a professor. When Ezreal discovered Lymere's theories on Zaun's ancient history as a Shuriman port city called Oshra Va'Zaun, he felt a bit of pity due to his lack of evidence and traversed the Vault of Resplendent Hollies to search for some to bring back, yet intended to take all the credit for himself.\nNe'Zuk is an ancient Ixtali Ascended tyrant who was long dead after Ezreal raided his tomb in search of his parents. Though his tomb held the gauntlet that Ezreal eventually took, it is actually a part of a pair of gauntlets that were originally wielded by another Ascended named Horok, who Ne'Zuk seemingly murdered and took the gauntlet from in ancient times. [ 10 ]\nEzreal encountered the Avarosan tribe when he travelled to the Freljord and stole a silver totem at the top of a freezing mountain. It's unclear what exactly transpired, but Ezreal insists on having never met the Avarosans, most likely in fear of being caught for something he did while grabbing the silver totem.\nThe Black Rose seem aware of Ezreal's name as a growing, renown adventurer. Though Ezreal doesn't seem completely aware of who the Black Rose are, he seems knowledgable about the dark magics hiding underneath the Noxian capital and encountered several Black Rose spies when he tried meeting with a mysterious contact for archival material at Noxus.\nThough Ezreal doesn't officially know who Neeko really is, he seemingly encountered her on his expedition to Paretha in search of the Elixir of Uloa. While in the jungles of Paretha, Ezreal encountered Neeko as she disguised herself as him, which Ezreal convinced himself was a hallucination from ingesting the taffa flower water.\nEzreal never formally met or was introduced to Illaoi, but he caught a clear glimpse of her while in Bilgewater , studying the Buhru culture and the origin of their religion. While enjoying the Buhru festivities, Ezreal saw Illaoi but focused more on her idol she carried around rather than the priestess herself.\nAs part of his mission to create a name for himself, Ezreal constantly wishes to join the Piltover Explorers Guild as an official member. However, the guild denied Ezreal's application and actively avoids accrediting him as a member. When speaking with another member of the guild named Januk, Ezreal learns that the guild isn't fond of Ezreal due to his unorthodox methods in exploration and possibly due to his prideful personality as well.\nBecause of this, Ezreal holds a lot of spite and disdain for the guild and its members for not allowing him to join. However, he still considers the denial of the guild to be one of the more painful things he's been denied entry in. [ 3 ]\nJanuk is a Freljordian member of the Piltover Explorers Guild who is most known for his illegal raiding of museums and dining on his collection of treasures. Despite working together on a couple adventures, the two consider each other rivals and even enemies due to a streak of betrayals on one another. Though Ezreal himself can't recall who started it, the earliest known instance is when Ezreal seemingly ran off with an important map that Januk needed. As payback, Januk blew Ezreal's cover when the two salvaged the wreck of a ship called the Echelon Dawn.\nMost recently, Januk agreed to pay and accredit Ezreal to the guild if he obtained the mystical Elixir of Uloa for him, which Ezreal did easily. However when he tried to deliver it, Januk betrayed him and revealed himself as a cultist in service to a fallen dreadlord . Ezreal managed to beat Januk by having him drink a laxative poison disguised as the potion before stealing his Ochnun bell and running out of his office window.\nEzreal met Kasdjar when he traveled to the Shuriman city of Bel'zhun , which had been occupied by Noxian rule. Ezreal hired Kasdjar to be his guide due to his notable charisma and knowledge on the ancient histories of Shurima. The two travelled together through the desert, ranging from the ancient city of Nerimazeth to the deserts of the Sai Kahleek .\nUnfortunately, at some unspecified point, Kasdjar perished when a giant obelisk fell and crushed him instantly. Ezreal, though he hardly knew Kasdjar, feels bad about his untimely death nonetheless.\nWhile travelling Shurima with his guide Kasdjar, Ezreal encountered and defeated many Xer'Sai creatures while traversing the southern sands of Sai Kahleek .\nEzreal hasn't encountered Rek'Sai herself but battled several of her Xer'Sai spawn while traversing the Sai Kahleek. Taking shelter inside a massive circular cavern, Ezreal's guide recognized the cave as massive Xer'Sai burrow and most likely the lair of Rek'Sai herself, who they referred to as the Sand Mother. Learning this, the two quickly left Rek'Sai's nest before she could return.\nThough the two have never met each other, Kassadin and Ezreal are intricately linked due to their pasts. Unaware to Ezreal, his gauntlet is a single part of a pair originally wielded by the Ascended hero Horok before Ne'Zuk murdered him and took the gauntlet for himself. Kassadin is aware of this knowledge and actually wields the second gauntlet that Horok managed to keep known as the Nether Blade . [ 11 ]\nThough not directly stated, it is heavily implied that Ezreal's parents actually knew Kassadin and hired him as a guide in search for Ne'Zuk's Tomb. However, the group actually found Horok's tomb instead holding the Nether Blade, which Ezreal's parents considered valuable all the same. [ 12 ]\nOn an expedition to obtain the Tear of the Goddess in a Shuriman tomb, Ezreal encountered Kai'Sa, who saved him from a swarm of Voidlings attacking him. Though she blew an exit in the tomb for Ezreal to escape out of, he refused to leave her and teleported in, fighting the swarm of Voidlings alongside her as the two quickly escaped the tomb together.\nThough their exact relationship is unknown, he is one of the few people that Kai'Sa considers a close friend alongside Taliyah .

His courage and bravado knowing no bounds, he prefers to improvise his way out of any situation, relying partially on his wits, but mostly on his mystical Shuriman gauntlet, which he uses to unleash devastating arcane blasts . One thing is for sure—whenever Ezreal is around, trouble isn’t too far behind. Or ahead. Probably everywhere.\nEzreal was born and raised in a wealthy neighborhood of Piltover as the son of two renowned archeologists. As explorers, Ezreal's parents were often away for extended periods of time on expeditions while Ezreal was taken care of by his uncle, Professor Lymere. Becoming used to his parents' absence, Ezreal loved hearing the stories his parents would tell him of their adventures, often fantasizing about joining them on their travels. Ezreal's father would typically tell him the stories of their travels, eventually sharing his plans for an incredibly secretive and ambitious expedition. Ezreal's father sought out the Tomb of Ne'Zuk , a Shuriman tyrant rumored to have the ability to jump from one place to another. He would often joke to the young Ezreal that, if he learned Ne'Zuk's teleportation magic, he would use it to continue his travels and jump back into Piltover in time for dinner.\nProfessor Lymere had trouble raising Ezreal, who was an unruly and rash child, often being tutored on various subjects just to keep him busy and out of trouble. These subjects included advanced cartography, Hextech mechanics and ancient histories of Runeterra , which Ezreal found extremely easy to grasp thanks to his prodigal skill in learning. Seeing studying as a waste of time, he often passed all assessments easily with little or no preparation, infuriating his uncle as he had more free time to roam the university grounds. Being a troublemaker, Ezreal often spent time evading campus wardens, navigating tunnels underneath lecture halls and even practicing lockpicking to sneak into his teachers' offices and rearrange their belongings.\nAs Ezreal grew older, the absences of his parents became longer to the point where they simply didn't return home one day. At that point, Ezreal's uncle tearfully admitted that the two had most likely died somewhere in the Shuriman desert, which Ezreal simply couldn't accept. Having heard of all the preparations and studies his parents would make for these expeditions, Ezreal was still convinced that his parents were still out there somewhere. Ezreal decided he'd find his parents on his own as he planned to search the location of their most important expedition; the Tomb of Ne'Zuk. In preparation, Ezreal abandoned his studies and gathered supplies from the university such as celestial diagrams, runic sigil translations, guides on the burial rites of Shurima and even a pair of protective goggles. Leaving a farewell note for his uncle, Ezreal snuck onto a supply ship heading towards the Shuriman city of Nashramae . The ship's captain discovered Ezreal as a stowaway and threatened to throw Ezreal overboard before he convinced them otherwise by agreeing to act as their navigator, as the previous navigator was unfortunately lost at sea.\nIn Shurima, Ezreal followed his mother's meticulous field notes and crossed the The Great Sai with merchant caravans. For months, Ezreal explored the most ancient Shuriman locations as he delved into cavernous ruins beneath the sands and faced unspeakable horrors that guarded hidden chambers, imagining himself as following his parents' path as an adventurer.\nThe left gauntlet of Ne'Zuk, which Ezreal found within the lost tomb .\nFinally, Ezreal found the tomb of Ne'Zuk underneath a mausoleum for some unnamed emperor, achieving what his parents unfortunately couldn't. The sarcophagus in the tomb however was empty, save for a gleaming bronze gauntlet with a crystalline matrix at its center. As soon as Ezreal touched it, the tomb began to turn on him, activating various thousand year old traps and wards. Improvising and thinking on instinct, Ezreal used the gauntlet and shot out a powerful blast of arcane energy to create a hole for him to exit through. He then teleported instantly to the hidden entrance right before the entire tomb collapsed into sand.\nHaving barely escaped, Ezreal looked down at the mysterious gauntlet as it hummed in-sync with his heartbeat, feeling it siphoning and amplifying his own magical essence. After some investigation, Ezreal discovered that the gauntlet was a fearsome weapon belonging to an Ascended God-Warrior , which he saw as perfect for an explorer like himself.\nHaving found the mystical gauntlet in Ne'Zuk's now collapsed tomb, Ezreal soon returned to Piltover and continued to go on various adventures and expeditions. Ezreal travelled to lost cities, mystical temples and other ancient locations that university professors would only read about on maps, slowly growing his reputation as a treasure-seeking explorer as many would begin telling stories of his exploits, which Ezreal usually saw as incapable of conveying the true scope and scale of his feats. Ezreal chased fame and glory throughout all parts of the world to create a name for himself, but he still hoped that his parents would one day catch word of his grand explorations and eventually seek him out in person.\nIn order to become an officially renowned explorer, Ezreal desperately sought to join the esteemed Piltover Explorers Guild, a widespread organization consisting of Runeterra's best explorers and adventurers. However, Ezreal would be denied entry into the Explorers Guild for currently unknown reasons, angering Ezreal since he believed he was more than qualified to join because of all the dangerous adventures he'd already gone on, and even seeking full acreditation on the guild in exchange for artifact retrieval jobs, like the time he was hired by Januk, a freljordian explorer member of the guild in such way.\nFollowing Professor Lymere's theories about Zaun's ancient history as a Shuriman port city once called Oshra Va'Zaun, Ezreal realized that his uncle had no proof for his theories and decided to search the deepest parts of Zaun to find proof and take credit. [ 1 ] Eventually, Ezreal would discover stories about the Vault of Resplendent Hollies , an ancient and renowned Shuriman vault believed to be full of artifacts and lost temples. [ 2 ] Ezreal eventually learned from a few sources that industrial excavations in Zaun have opened up a crack in the deepest and flooded depths of the Sump layer of Zaun, which he delved into in search of the vault.\nEzreal discovering the doors to the Vault of Resplendent Holies beneath Zaun's Sump\nAs Ezreal began to lose morale over finding nothing within the depths, he managed to find an ancient door most likely to the Vault of Resplendent Holies. The door was lined with various Shuriman glyphs, including a few that resembled owls, which Ezreal deciphered as a warning about a curse that 'multiplies' into a thousand curses, though his Shuriman was candid and rusty. Unable to unlock the door, Ezreal shot a blast of arcane magic through it, creating a hole for him to enter.\nEzreal hiding from fiery Golems within the vault.\nOnce inside the vault, Ezreal found various relics such as one that belonged to Carikkan, the Shuriman emperor's personal spirit-banisher who bound troublesome entities to inanimate objects for his own dark purposes. While rummaging through Carikkan's many relics, Ezreal encountered an army of fiery stone-warrior Golems that defended Carikkan's artifats, which he easily obliterated with shots of arcane energy. Another artifact that Ezreal found was a perfectly preserved golden stele inscribed with the legend of the \"Day of Fire\" and Carikkan's oath to protect Oshra Va'Zaun.\nAfter defeating more fiery Golems, a rush of water started to flood in through the cracks of the floor, forcing Ezreal to swim through tunnels to reach the surface again while carrying the golden stele. Managing to escape, Ezreal traveled back to Piltover and visited Zaile's , an outfitter store where Ezreal intended to get his jacket, now torn to shreds, tailored and repaired. Ezreal intended to look as good as possible so that he can impress the Explorers Guild by presenting his journal recording his explorations within the Vault of Resplendent Holies.\nEzreal preparing to fire a blast of energy at the swarm of locusts he acidentally unleashed.\nWhile getting his jacket tailored at Zaile's, Ezreal left the golden stele by a window, causing it to come in contact with direct sunlight during an equinox. The stele began to glow and speak in an ancient language before exploding into a swarm of infernal locust creatures. As more locusts began to pour out of the sewer grates, Ezreal helped clear them out by using blasts from his gauntlet. A few days later, Ezreal faced legal repercussions for bringing the dangerous artifact into Piltover and causing property damage to the mercantile district. Though he sought legal advice and read up on Piltover's libel and slander laws, he ultimately decided to represent himself in court. In order to prove his innocence however, Ezreal quickly logged a possibly false log on his journal to act as evidence, which directly stated that he had nothing to do with the outbreak and blamed the clerk at Zaile's for placing the stele in the sunlight. [ 1 ]\nEzreal continued his adventurous expeditions across the world, writing them in his field notes to record his endeavors and impress the Explorers Guild so they can grant him membership:\nEzreal first traveled southwest of Piltover to the city of Bel'zhun, located in northern Shurima and occupied by Noxian rule. Ezreal knew that the best guides in Shurima were found in the coastal city and found Kasdjar, a knowledgeable and charismatic guide who shared many details about the ancient histories of Shurima as they travelled.\nThe two traveled through the desert together, at some point going to the ancient city of Nerimazeth . While scouring the ruins for priceless artifacts, Kasdjar shared many historical facts about the lands outside of the city, noting that they were once home to the first prototype Sun Disc before it failed and collapsed. Towards the south of Sai Kahleek , Ezreal encountered many Xer'Sai creatures, defending him and his guide by using the magic of his gauntlet. The two took shelter in a circular cavern, which Kasdjar quickly realized was a gargantuan Xer'Sai burrow and the lair of the Sand Mother as the two quickly left as soon as they could. At some point, Kasdjar was tragically killed when a massive obelisk fell on him. Despite this, Ezreal continued his adventure down south reached the edge of Icathia , which he immediately saw as way too dangerous and turned around instantly.\nAt some point, Ezreal sailed out of the Shuriman jungles and shipwrecked on a deserted island home to mysterious, albeit aggressively flirtatious walrus-esque beings. After about a week, Ezreal repaired his ship and sailed back to the main land.\nIn the Noxian capital city, Ezreal once planned to meet a new, mysterious contact to collect archival materials. While waiting for her, Ezreal strolled the promenades surrounding the Immortal Bastion , sampling Noxian cuisine, notably their tacos, and inspecting he monoliths of dark magic that made up the fortress. Ezreal's contact never showed, but he noticed many spies following him until one of them handed him a rose petal colored black . Now sensing danger, Ezreal decided to leave the city and found black petals every day until he left the border, even finding one in his satchel.\nIn the Demacian city of Jandelle , Ezreal searched for a pair of masks supposedly belonging to the Kindred themselves, having been carved out of a bewitched eldlock tree. While searching though, Ezreal began to reminisce on an old tale about a famous Demacian actress who died on stage while playing the dual role of Kindred. Though the masks she wore for that role mysteriously disappeared, Ezreal theorized that these were the original masks of the Kindred and believed they were most likely locked away in a collector's show room.\nWhile staying in Demacia, Ezreal took on the alias of Jarro Lightfeather , a fake identity of a Sentinel of Light who was born in Vaskasia . While taking on the name of Jarro Lightfeather, Ezreal met various Demacians and became a renowned and seemingly infamous national hero.\nAt the eastern parts of Rakelstake in the Freljord, Ezreal encountered the Avarosans and procured a silver totem at the top of a freezing mountain. After that, Ezreal faced trouble with the tribe and fled as quickly as possible, denying any claims that he was ever in the Freljord to the Avarosans.\nWhile sailing around the oceans east of Mount Targon , Ezreal took in the beauty of the Targonian night sky. At the same time however, Ezreal helped quell a mutiny that occurred on the ship he had stowed away on.\nIn Bilgewater , Ezreal studied the local Buhru culture on the Blue Flame Isles , which he knew as the Serpent Isles , and came to learn that their religion predates everything found on both Valoran and Shurima. Having joined in on the festive ceremonies of the Buhru, Ezreal caught sight of Illaoi , curiously examining the massive idol she carried on her.\nAt the southern parts of the Renek River , Ezreal faced off against the eight tribes of the Southern Dune Wanderers, who chased him through the mountains for stealing their sacred medallion. While running though, Ezreal found a rock with a shimmering gap in it, opening up a portal to Bandle City before vanishing. Though Ezreal camped out for a week to see it again, it never reappeared and Ezreal convinced himself it may have been a hallucination.\nIn Mudtown , Ezreal got captured by a gang of marauders who took his gauntlet and possibly other belongings. However, after playing a game of Krakenhand with the gang, Ezreal quickly befriended the gang members and proved his worth to them. Despite not knowing how to play whatsoever, Ezreal managed to win his gauntlet back along with an antique flintlock. [ 2 ]\nEzreal, wanting to once again apply for membership in the Explorers Guild, reunited with Januk, a Freljordian explorer known for illegally raiding museums, and with whom the explorer had already worked before, albeit in uneasy terms as they constantly betrayed one another on their adventures. One instance of such betrayals was when Januk, as payback for the time Ezreal ran off with an important map, purposefully blew Ezreal's cover after they salvaged the wreck of a ship called the Echelon Dawn, which in turn prompted Ezreal to leave him behind on a noxian prision camp. Despite this, Ezreal agreed to do a job for him; find the mythical Elixir of Uloa, a potion sought out by many cults and believed to imbue people with immortality upon consumption. In return, Januk agreed to pay Ezreal sixty thousand, along with full accreditation in the guild. [ 3 ]\nSearching for the elixir in the Shuriman jungles, Ezreal arrived in the village of Paretha . While staying at the village, Ezreal traveled to the Vale of Silver Mist , a magical part of the jungles outside of Paretha. After drinking some taffa-flower water he found in the jungle, Ezreal found what appeared to be an exact copy of himself curiously peering at him from behind a tree, which he choked up to hallucinations from drinking the flower water. [ 2 ]\nEzreal discovering a mysterious temple in Paretha , which housed the Elixir of Uloa.\nAfter a few hours in the jungles, Ezreal found an underground crypt and entered it, easily traversing the many labyrinthine tunnels and traps until he reached a room with the Elixir of Uloa sitting on top of a pedestal. Anticipating more traps to activate if he approaches the vial, Ezreal carefully stepped towards it and lightly grasped the elixir, causing hundreds of sharp stakes to drop, which he narrowly escaped by teleporting away at the last second. Noticing the tomb's supports begin to fall apart, Ezreal quickly traversed back the way he came, escaping the chamber as the floors began to crack and split. Giant insects with large pincers and red eyes began to crawl through the collapsed walls, attacking Ezreal as he defended himself with a few blasts from his gauntlet. As Ezreal slid towards the exit, the chamber suddenly fell apart right in front of him and closed off his only exit out of the crypt. Just in type though, Ezreal blasted a hole through the collapsed chamber with his magical gauntlet and left with the Elixir of Uloa in hand while the tomb's entrance began to cave in completely. [ 4 ]\nWith the elixir in his possession, Ezreal stayed in Paretha to gather supplies. A tribal shaman of the village claimed that Ezreal's soul was entwined with the Aspect of the Wanderer, which confused Ezreal as he didn't think the shaman looked Targonian. Not wishing to face the citizens of Paretha when they realize he caused the collapse of their ancient temple, Ezreal quickly left and began travelling back to Januk to deliver the elixir. [ 2 ]\nMeeting with Jaunk, Ezreal described the feats he pulled when trying to achieve the elixir but refused to give it without the proper payment. Though Januk offered him his payment in money, Ezreal added that he wanted full accreditation within the Explorers Guild as well, which Januk didn't wanna comply with since the Guild weren't very fond of Ezreal and neither was Januk. When Ezreal threatened to give the elixir to a different buyer, Januk laughed it off and went to his office to grab a letter that can grant Ezreal full accreditation in the guild, which Ezreal easily realized was a potential betrayal about to happen. While examining a peculiar bell in Januk's collection, Ezreal heard him state that the bell had Ochnun written on it; the language of the dead. Turning around to face Januk, Ezreal saw him pointing two flintlock pistols at his head.\nEzreal and an angry Januk pointing his flintlock pistols.\nJanuk stated that Ezreal's application to the guild has been denied and revealed that he's part of a cult that sought to use the elixir to raise a fallen dreadlord from the dead. Dodging the gunshots with his teleportation magic, Januk grabbed Ezreal by the gauntlet and tossed him to the floor before kicking his ribs and snagging the elixir out of his grip. After proudly drinking it, Ezreal revealed that the elixir he just drank was actually a bottle of sand wasp venom; a very potent laxative. As he pulled out the true elixir, Januk groaned and collapsed on the floor while Ezreal quickly grabbed the Ochnun bell and leapt out of Januk's office window, hoping to bring the bell back to the Explorers Guild as a way to earn membership. [ 3 ]\nKai'Sa and Ezreal fighting off a swarm of Voidlings together.\nOn a recent expedition to Shurima, Ezreal managed to locate an ancient temple holding the legendary artifact known as the Tear of the Goddess . After removing the magical gem from its base, the temple triggered a mechanism that released a swarm of Voidling creatures from the ground and slowly sealed the temple entrance. Just as the door closed and the swarm closed in, Kai'Sa flew down and blasted a bunch of Voidlings and a hole through the closed entrance. Kai'Sa continued fighting off the swarm while Ezreal had a chance to run off with the gemstone. However, Ezreal hesitated and noticed Kai'Sa getting overwhelmed by the amount of Voidlings, dropping the gem and firing an arcane blast at the creatures before teleporting at Kai'Sa's side. The two fought alongside each other and cleared out most of the swarm as they quickly rushed towards the exit, managing to escape and eventually part ways. [ 5 ]\nEzreal is a young slim pale skinned man with tousled blonde hair and blue eyes.\nHe wears a small brown leather jacket, sometimes undersized so it barely reaches his waist, and some others a more regular sized one. In some versions of the jacket, the collar has a deep-blue furry lining, while in others the jacket has a hood in which the lining is shorter and more wooly-looking, but of a similar color.  Both of his sleeves are rolled up, exposing his forearms. Underneath the jacket. he wears a white shirt with a low V-neck which is adorned with brown colored diamond motives. Since its sleeves can't be seen on his arms, it is either a short-sleeved t-shirt or a tank top. On his left hand he wears an oversized bronze colored (depicted usually more yellowish) glove shaped Shuriman artifact known as the Gauntlet of Ne'Zuk. On his right hand he wears a fingerless glove, probably made from some kind of leather too.\nHe also wears dark high boots and skinny jeans with a pair of belts: one for the jeans themselves and another with several pockets. He wears a secondary thigh belt with an extra pocket in his right leg and has both knees protected by brown colored pads sewed into the jeans.\nHis most distinctive physical feature is the pair of triangular-shaped light blue colored marks appearing right on his cheekbones, products of magic expression in his body that glow brighter when he channels magical energy. [ 6 ] He also wears a pair of protective glasses, either tightened into his head or  hanging from his neck.\nEzreal is an intelligent and cunning young man that appears to be an arrogant, and narcissistic person. He also seems to be a very self-confident individual, always getting into trouble and not being very careful of traps and monsters he encounters as he explores, not caring about the 'collateral damage' he might incur in when exploring. [ 7 ]\nAs stated in his biography, at least part of his attention-seeking behavior comes from a young age. Back when he was kid attending university at petition of his uncle, he was already known for his troublemaking behavior, lockpicking into restricted areas, evading the university wardens, rearranging the professors desks, and even for more infamous and notoriously complex pranks. [ 8 ] Even in his shenanigans as explorer, not taking into account any rules or legal proceedings to do things, all in hopes of his parents being out there and coming back to him if he makes enough of a reputation as an explorer.\nDespite showing this ego-inflated attitude, Ezreal is a wounded inside individual that uses this confident exterior to cover trauma he wouldn't admit having. [ 7 ] [ 9 ] He is a very critical individual of the people and city he grew up in , because he sees his own flaws exaggerated in them. [ 9 ]\nHe has a rather evident image problem, dissonant with his exterior self-centered attitude, Ezreal appears to not stand looking to his reflection in a mirror. [ 9 ]\nEzreal's parents were renown archaeologists of Piltover who, due to their expeditions and adventures outside of Piltover, would often leave Ezreal under the care of his uncle Professor Lymere. Despite their absences, they had a very clear love for their son and kept a good relationship with him on the short occasions that they'd return home to see him.\nEzreal's father would often tell him of their many adventures in the form of stories that amazed the young boy, sparking his initial interest in adventuring and following in his parents' footsteps. Ezreal initially heard the story of Ne'Zuk from his father, who often described it as being his most ambitiously planned expedition as he joked to learn Ne'Zuk's teleportation magic so that he can instantly teleport back home after an adventure.\nEzreal's mother was a talented navigator and the one who wrote meticulous field notes that Ezreal eventually used to help him navigate Shurima when he initially searched for the Tomb of Ne'Zuk.\nAfter their sudden disappearence, their fates remain unknown despite Ezreal's uncle believing that they most likely died on their adventure. However, Ezreal simply refuses to believe that and constantly copes with the idea that they'll eventually return. To this day, Ezreal continues to create a name for himself as a famous explorer with the intent of making sure his parents catch word of their son's grand feats, hopefully convincing them to return home finally.\nProfessor Lymere is Ezreal's uncle and the one who primarily took care of him while growing up due to the absence of his parents. Due to Ezreal's troublesome nature as a child, the two had a rocky and tumultuous relationship. In order to occupy the boy and keep him from causing trouble, Professor Lymere enrolled him into college level courses, which proved ineffective due to Ezreal's incredible ability to absorb and retain knowledge. Freeing up his time from his uncle's classes, Ezreal would continue to cause mischief on the university campus, often angering Professor Lymere.\nTo this day the two stay in touch and, despite their turbulent relationship, Ezreal seems to share some respect for his uncle as a professor. When Ezreal discovered Lymere's theories on Zaun's ancient history as a Shuriman port city called Oshra Va'Zaun, he felt a bit of pity due to his lack of evidence and traversed the Vault of Resplendent Hollies to search for some to bring back, yet intended to take all the credit for himself.\nNe'Zuk is an ancient Ixtali Ascended tyrant who was long dead after Ezreal raided his tomb in search of his parents. Though his tomb held the gauntlet that Ezreal eventually took, it is actually a part of a pair of gauntlets that were originally wielded by another Ascended named Horok, who Ne'Zuk seemingly murdered and took the gauntlet from in ancient times. [ 10 ]\nEzreal encountered the Avarosan tribe when he travelled to the Freljord and stole a silver totem at the top of a freezing mountain. It's unclear what exactly transpired, but Ezreal insists on having never met the Avarosans, most likely in fear of being caught for something he did while grabbing the silver totem.\nThe Black Rose seem aware of Ezreal's name as a growing, renown adventurer. Though Ezreal doesn't seem completely aware of who the Black Rose are, he seems knowledgable about the dark magics hiding underneath the Noxian capital and encountered several Black Rose spies when he tried meeting with a mysterious contact for archival material at Noxus.\nThough Ezreal doesn't officially know who Neeko really is, he seemingly encountered her on his expedition to Paretha in search of the Elixir of Uloa. While in the jungles of Paretha, Ezreal encountered Neeko as she disguised herself as him, which Ezreal convinced himself was a hallucination from ingesting the taffa flower water.\nEzreal never formally met or was introduced to Illaoi, but he caught a clear glimpse of her while in Bilgewater , studying the Buhru culture and the origin of their religion. While enjoying the Buhru festivities, Ezreal saw Illaoi but focused more on her idol she carried around rather than the priestess herself.\nAs part of his mission to create a name for himself, Ezreal constantly wishes to join the Piltover Explorers Guild as an official member. However, the guild denied Ezreal's application and actively avoids accrediting him as a member. When speaking with another member of the guild named Januk, Ezreal learns that the guild isn't fond of Ezreal due to his unorthodox methods in exploration and possibly due to his prideful personality as well.\nBecause of this, Ezreal holds a lot of spite and disdain for the guild and its members for not allowing him to join. However, he still considers the denial of the guild to be one of the more painful things he's been denied entry in. [ 3 ]\nJanuk is a Freljordian member of the Piltover Explorers Guild who is most known for his illegal raiding of museums and dining on his collection of treasures. Despite working together on a couple adventures, the two consider each other rivals and even enemies due to a streak of betrayals on one another. Though Ezreal himself can't recall who started it, the earliest known instance is when Ezreal seemingly ran off with an important map that Januk needed. As payback, Januk blew Ezreal's cover when the two salvaged the wreck of a ship called the Echelon Dawn.\nMost recently, Januk agreed to pay and accredit Ezreal to the guild if he obtained the mystical Elixir of Uloa for him, which Ezreal did easily. However when he tried to deliver it, Januk betrayed him and revealed himself as a cultist in service to a fallen dreadlord . Ezreal managed to beat Januk by having him drink a laxative poison disguised as the potion before stealing his Ochnun bell and running out of his office window.\nEzreal met Kasdjar when he traveled to the Shuriman city of Bel'zhun , which had been occupied by Noxian rule. Ezreal hired Kasdjar to be his guide due to his notable charisma and knowledge on the ancient histories of Shurima. The two travelled together through the desert, ranging from the ancient city of Nerimazeth to the deserts of the Sai Kahleek .\nUnfortunately, at some unspecified point, Kasdjar perished when a giant obelisk fell and crushed him instantly. Ezreal, though he hardly knew Kasdjar, feels bad about his untimely death nonetheless.\nWhile travelling Shurima with his guide Kasdjar, Ezreal encountered and defeated many Xer'Sai creatures while traversing the southern sands of Sai Kahleek .\nEzreal hasn't encountered Rek'Sai herself but battled several of her Xer'Sai spawn while traversing the Sai Kahleek. Taking shelter inside a massive circular cavern, Ezreal's guide recognized the cave as massive Xer'Sai burrow and most likely the lair of Rek'Sai herself, who they referred to as the Sand Mother. Learning this, the two quickly left Rek'Sai's nest before she could return.\nThough the two have never met each other, Kassadin and Ezreal are intricately linked due to their pasts. Unaware to Ezreal, his gauntlet is a single part of a pair originally wielded by the Ascended hero Horok before Ne'Zuk murdered him and took the gauntlet for himself. Kassadin is aware of this knowledge and actually wields the second gauntlet that Horok managed to keep known as the Nether Blade . [ 11 ]\nThough not directly stated, it is heavily implied that Ezreal's parents actually knew Kassadin and hired him as a guide in search for Ne'Zuk's Tomb. However, the group actually found Horok's tomb instead holding the Nether Blade, which Ezreal's parents considered valuable all the same. [ 12 ]\nOn an expedition to obtain the Tear of the Goddess in a Shuriman tomb, Ezreal encountered Kai'Sa, who saved him from a swarm of Voidlings attacking him. Though she blew an exit in the tomb for Ezreal to escape out of, he refused to leave her and teleported in, fighting the swarm of Voidlings alongside her as the two quickly escaped the tomb together.\nThough their exact relationship is unknown, he is one of the few people that Kai'Sa considers a close friend alongside Taliyah .

Often mistaken for some manner of capricious ocean spirit, he seems able to command the beasts of the deep, and delights in confounding his allies and enemies alike.\nIn ages past, the oceans of Runeterra were home to civilizations far older than those of the land.

Even though he was not one of them, they treated him as an equal, and his playful nature and tall tales of adventures in the open sea made him welcome at any gathering.\nBut the world was changing. The oceans were growing warmer, emboldening fierce predators to rise up from the deepest trenches. Other settlements had fallen silent, but the rulers of the great city could still not agree on how to deal with the threat. Fizz pledged to roam the seas in search of survivors, or anyone who knew what had happened.\nThen, one dark day, the gigalodons came.\nThese huge dragon-sharks stunned their prey with fell shrieking, and the avenues of the great city were soon clouded red. Thousands died in a matter of hours, the immense bulk of their killers crushing towers and temples in a monstrous feeding frenzy.

His light blue skin transitions into darker hues towards his lower body, adorned with white spots, notably on his stomach.\nWhile Fizz's distinctive appearance is likely a result of his environment, it remains unclear why there aren't more Yordles who share his likeness.

Once, he ruled the port city of Bilgewater , and while his reign is over, there are those who believe this has only made him more dangerous. Gangplank would see Bilgewater bathed in blood once more before letting someone else take it—and now with pistol, cutlass, and barrels of gunpowder, he is determined to reclaim what he has lost.\n(TBA)\n(TBA)\nGangplank is a cruel pirate captain who maintains his power through fear alone. As such, he can be exceedingly brutal in his methods, even torturing members of his own crew should they step out of line. With bone-carving and mutilation, Gangplank also showcases an artistic side in his own sick and twisted way. In his quest to be feared, Gangplank often touts his own reputation to frighten people into submission. He often remarks at how many have tried (and failed) to kill him, and shows a remarkable resistance to pain when he orders a doctor to amputate his arm without a fuss. Gangplank is shown to have little remorse for his cruel behavior, killing Sarah Fortune's mother without mercy.\n(TBA)\nGangplank and Illaoi were in a relationship over a decade ago, but eventually broke up. After subjecting him to a Test of Spirit in order to get him back 'in motion', the Kraken Priestess ordered the Serpent Islander chiefs to support the Saltwater Scourge in retaking Bilgewater. They would lead Gangplank to Buhru artifacts that could control the Black Mist. Illaoi was Gangplank's first love. She would eventually oppose him alongside Ahri , Braum , Miss Fortune , Pyke , and Yasuo in Ruined King .\nGangplank would enter a partnership with Thresh in Ruined King , in order to awaken and subjugate Viego to conquer Bilgewater. Viego's power would prove too strong for Gangplank and ended up controlling him instead.\nSwain and Zed want Gangplank dead for stealing from each of them. Namely, Gangplank stole Swain's personal warship known as the Leviathan and ransacked the Temple of the Jagged Knife belonging to Zed's Shadow Order .\nMiss Fortune managed to overthrow and 'kill' Gangplank in revenge for him murdering her mother back when she was a girl. Gangplank had only thought of Miss Fortune as the most persistent of bounty hunters, unaware that she is the daughter of the gunsmith he killed when she refused to hand over the twin pistols he had commissioned in order to spearhead his rise to Reaver King of Bilgewater.\nMiss Fortune would defeat Gangplank again in Ruined King and had him detained in order to publicly execute him as a show of power. He would escape before his execution and entered a massive gang war against Fortune."}

Once, he ruled the port city of Bilgewater , and while his reign is over, there are those who believe this has only made him more dangerous. Gangplank would see Bilgewater bathed in blood once more before letting someone else take it—and now with pistol, cutlass, and barrels of gunpowder, he is determined to reclaim what he has lost.\n(TBA)\n(TBA)\nGangplank is a cruel pirate captain who maintains his power through fear alone. As such, he can be exceedingly brutal in his methods, even torturing members of his own crew should they step out of line. With bone-carving and mutilation, Gangplank also showcases an artistic side in his own sick and twisted way. In his quest to be feared, Gangplank often touts his own reputation to frighten people into submission. He often remarks at how many have tried (and failed) to kill him, and shows a remarkable resistance to pain when he orders a doctor to amputate his arm without a fuss. Gangplank is shown to have little remorse for his cruel behavior, killing Sarah Fortune's mother without mercy.\n(TBA)\nGangplank and Illaoi were in a relationship over a decade ago, but eventually broke up. After subjecting him to a Test of Spirit in order to get him back 'in motion', the Kraken Priestess ordered the Serpent Islander chiefs to support the Saltwater Scourge in retaking Bilgewater. They would lead Gangplank to Buhru artifacts that could control the Black Mist. Illaoi was Gangplank's first love. She would eventually oppose him alongside Ahri , Braum , Miss Fortune , Pyke , and Yasuo in Ruined King .\nGangplank would enter a partnership with Thresh in Ruined King , in order to awaken and subjugate Viego to conquer Bilgewater. Viego's power would prove too strong for Gangplank and ended up controlling him instead.\nSwain and Zed want Gangplank dead for stealing from each of them. Namely, Gangplank stole Swain's personal warship known as the Leviathan and ransacked the Temple of the Jagged Knife belonging to Zed's Shadow Order .\nMiss Fortune managed to overthrow and 'kill' Gangplank in revenge for him murdering her mother back when she was a girl. Gangplank had only thought of Miss Fortune as the most persistent of bounty hunters, unaware that she is the daughter of the gunsmith he killed when she refused to hand over the twin pistols he had commissioned in order to spearhead his rise to Reaver King of Bilgewater.\nMiss Fortune would defeat Gangplank again in Ruined King and had him detained in order to publicly execute him as a show of power. He would escape before his execution and entered a massive gang war against Fortune."}

Frozen in True Ice for millennia, the curious creature broke free and now hops about a changed world he sees as exotic and wondrous. Delighted by danger, Gnar flings whatever he can at his enemies, be it his bonetooth boomerang... or an uprooted tree.\nBefore the ice had given the Freljord its name, there existed a land brimming with wonder—that is, if one could see the world through the eyes of Gnar.\nA young yordle with boundless energy, Gnar and others like him lived openly among the hardy tribes of the northlands. Though barely big enough to leave footprints in the snow, his temper rivaled that of beasts ten times his size, and he would erupt with a babble of curses the moment anything went amiss. For this reason, he felt more kinship with the greater and wiser creatures, who kept their distance from mortals. To Gnar, they looked like overgrown, white-furred yordles… and that was good enough for him.\nWhile the tribes foraged across the tundra, gathering wild berries and tasty moss, Gnar collected more essential items, like rocks, pebbles, and the muddy remains of dead birds. His greatest treasure was the jawbone of a drüvask. When he tugged it from the cold earth, he squealed with glee and flung it as far as he could.\nIt landed two hops away.\nThrilled by this early success, Gnar carried his “boomerang” wherever he went. The world would try its best to offer him new delights—shiny lint, sweet nectar, round things—but none could match the pure joy he felt in throwing and catching his cherished weapon. He now considered himself a hunter, and trailed herds of wild beasts that paid him no mind.\nBut even he could sense change coming to the land. The sky seemed darker. The winds felt colder. The mortal tribes who had once foraged together, now appeared to hunt each other…\nThe big white yordles would know what to do. Gnar would go to them.\nUsing all of his hunting skill, he tracked them into the snow-capped peaks of a vast mountain range, much farther than he had ever wandered before. As he approached unseen, he also saw more mortals than he could count. This was exciting, but no one else seemed too happy about it.\nThen the ground shook, and split apart. For the first time in Gnar’s life, it seemed as though everyone else was throwing tantrums. The mortals yelled. The big yordles roared.\nBut the monster’s arrival silenced them all.\nHeaving itself up from the newly opened abyss, it bore huge horns, whipping tentacles, and a single eye, burning with strange light that made the fur on Gnar’s back crawl. While some mortals fled at the sight, he began to feel an odd pain in his chest—it was like the thought of losing his boomerang, or never being hugged again. This horrible thing wanted to hurt his new friends.\nAnd this made him angry. In that moment, Gnar truly raged.\nAll he could see was the monster. In a flash, he was in the air, leaping toward it. In one paw, he grasped a snowball… or so he thought. In fact, it was a boulder plucked from the mountainside, for Gnar had grown as large as the big white yordles. He would send this monster back where it came from, by walloping its face!\nBut the blow never landed. Gnar felt a chill colder than any winter, one that seemed to turn the air itself into ice—truly, this elemental magic froze him in place, biting through his shaggy fur. Everything, including the monster, became quiet. The yordle’s strength and anger melted away. A deep tiredness crept into his limbs, and he fell softly asleep.\nGnar napped for a long time. When he finally awoke, he shook the frost from his shoulders, breathing heavily. Everyone else was gone. With no monsters to fight and no friends to protect, he felt very small and alone again.\nThe land was very different, too. There was snow everywhere , blanketing everything as far as his wide eyes could see. Still, he let out a happy yelp when he saw his beloved boomerang lying beside him, and scurried away to find something to hunt.\nEven now, Gnar has no grasp of what took place that fateful day, nor how he escaped. He simply marvels at the world before him, with so many oddities to collect and places to explore.\nLike most modern Yordles , Gnar boasts thick fur and prominent pointed ears. His entire body is enveloped in orange fur with white accents. Teal blue hues adorn the fur at the tips of his tail and ears. A distinctive tuft of chestnut-colored fur adorns his upper chest, forming a scarf-like appearance around his neck. Gnar's attire is minimal, consisting of a chestnut-colored loincloth as well as a small bird skull perched atop his head. Unlike modern Yordles, he has a pair of large lower canine teeth that protrude from his mouth.\nIn his enraged state, Gnar undergoes a significant increase in size.

Frozen in True Ice for millennia, the curious creature broke free and now hops about a changed world he sees as exotic and wondrous. Delighted by danger, Gnar flings whatever he can at his enemies, be it his bonetooth boomerang... or an uprooted tree.\nBefore the ice had given the Freljord its name, there existed a land brimming with wonder—that is, if one could see the world through the eyes of Gnar.\nA young yordle with boundless energy, Gnar and others like him lived openly among the hardy tribes of the northlands. Though barely big enough to leave footprints in the snow, his temper rivaled that of beasts ten times his size, and he would erupt with a babble of curses the moment anything went amiss. For this reason, he felt more kinship with the greater and wiser creatures, who kept their distance from mortals. To Gnar, they looked like overgrown, white-furred yordles… and that was good enough for him.\nWhile the tribes foraged across the tundra, gathering wild berries and tasty moss, Gnar collected more essential items, like rocks, pebbles, and the muddy remains of dead birds. His greatest treasure was the jawbone of a drüvask. When he tugged it from the cold earth, he squealed with glee and flung it as far as he could.\nIt landed two hops away.\nThrilled by this early success, Gnar carried his “boomerang” wherever he went. The world would try its best to offer him new delights—shiny lint, sweet nectar, round things—but none could match the pure joy he felt in throwing and catching his cherished weapon. He now considered himself a hunter, and trailed herds of wild beasts that paid him no mind.\nBut even he could sense change coming to the land. The sky seemed darker. The winds felt colder. The mortal tribes who had once foraged together, now appeared to hunt each other…\nThe big white yordles would know what to do. Gnar would go to them.\nUsing all of his hunting skill, he tracked them into the snow-capped peaks of a vast mountain range, much farther than he had ever wandered before. As he approached unseen, he also saw more mortals than he could count. This was exciting, but no one else seemed too happy about it.\nThen the ground shook, and split apart. For the first time in Gnar’s life, it seemed as though everyone else was throwing tantrums. The mortals yelled. The big yordles roared.\nBut the monster’s arrival silenced them all.\nHeaving itself up from the newly opened abyss, it bore huge horns, whipping tentacles, and a single eye, burning with strange light that made the fur on Gnar’s back crawl. While some mortals fled at the sight, he began to feel an odd pain in his chest—it was like the thought of losing his boomerang, or never being hugged again. This horrible thing wanted to hurt his new friends.\nAnd this made him angry. In that moment, Gnar truly raged.\nAll he could see was the monster. In a flash, he was in the air, leaping toward it. In one paw, he grasped a snowball… or so he thought. In fact, it was a boulder plucked from the mountainside, for Gnar had grown as large as the big white yordles. He would send this monster back where it came from, by walloping its face!\nBut the blow never landed. Gnar felt a chill colder than any winter, one that seemed to turn the air itself into ice—truly, this elemental magic froze him in place, biting through his shaggy fur. Everything, including the monster, became quiet. The yordle’s strength and anger melted away. A deep tiredness crept into his limbs, and he fell softly asleep.\nGnar napped for a long time. When he finally awoke, he shook the frost from his shoulders, breathing heavily. Everyone else was gone. With no monsters to fight and no friends to protect, he felt very small and alone again.\nThe land was very different, too. There was snow everywhere , blanketing everything as far as his wide eyes could see. Still, he let out a happy yelp when he saw his beloved boomerang lying beside him, and scurried away to find something to hunt.\nEven now, Gnar has no grasp of what took place that fateful day, nor how he escaped. He simply marvels at the world before him, with so many oddities to collect and places to explore.\nLike most modern Yordles , Gnar boasts thick fur and prominent pointed ears. His entire body is enveloped in orange fur with white accents. Teal blue hues adorn the fur at the tips of his tail and ears. A distinctive tuft of chestnut-colored fur adorns his upper chest, forming a scarf-like appearance around his neck. Gnar's attire is minimal, consisting of a chestnut-colored loincloth as well as a small bird skull perched atop his head. Unlike modern Yordles, he has a pair of large lower canine teeth that protrude from his mouth.\nIn his enraged state, Gnar undergoes a significant increase in size. In this transformed state, he lacks full fur coverage, exposing a gray skin underneath. The color of his fur shifts from orange to a deep, dark red. His already sizable lower canine teeth experience further growth, now matching the size of his ears. The teal blue hues that previously adorned the tips of his tail and ears extend to encompass his enlarged arms, chin, eyebrows and upper back.\nGnar has the mentality of a young child. He has boundless energy, a penchant for playfulness, and an occasional tendency toward tantrums. His affinity for collecting seemingly mundane items, like rocks and pebbles, highlights his whimsical nature and childlike curiosity. Gnar's attachment to his makeshift boomerang reflects his genuine happiness derived from the uncomplicated joys of play.\nGnar possesses a fiery temper. When faced with the arrival of a threat, Gnar's protective instincts and anger emerge, showcasing his loyalty to his newfound friends and a courageous, albeit impulsive, readiness to confront danger. Despite his fierce temper, Gnar's quickness to forgive and his fundamentally nice nature shine through, especially when others reciprocate kindness."}

Even though he has an explosive temper, he possesses a sense of criminal honor, often enforced at the business end of his double-barreled shotgun Destiny . In recent years, he has reconciled a troubled partnership with Twisted Fate , and together they have prospered once more in the turmoil of Bilgewater’s criminal underbelly.\nRaised in the wharf alleys of Bilgewater , Malcolm Graves quickly learned how to fight and how to steal. He could always find work hauling contraband up from the smugglers’ skiffs that came into the bay each night—with a tidy side-gig as hired muscle for various other unsavory local characters, as they went about their business in the port.\nBut the alleys were small-time, and he craved more excitement than they could offer. Still little more than a youth, Graves stole a blunderbuss and smuggled himself aboard a ship headed out of Bilgewater to the Shuriman mainland , where he stole, lied, and gambled his way from place to place along the coast.\nAcross the table of a high-stakes—and highly illegal—card game in Mudtown , Graves met Twisted Fate .\nEach immediately saw in the other the same reckless passion for danger and adventure, and together they formed a most lucrative partnership. Between Graves’ raw brawn and Twisted Fate’s brains, they were an unusually effective team from the outset. Their mutual sense of roguish honor grew into genuine trust, and together they stole from the rich, swindled the foolish, handpicked skilled crews for specific jobs, and sold out their rivals whenever they could.\nOn the southern borderlands of Valoran , they set two renowned noble houses of Noxus at each other’s throats as cover for the rescue of a kidnapped heir. That they pocketed the reward money, only to ransom the vile young man to the highest bidder, should really have come as no surprise to their original employer. In Piltover , they still hold the distinction of being the only thieves ever to crack the supposedly impenetrable Clockwork Vault. Not only did the pair empty the vault of all its treasures, they also tricked the guards into loading the loot onto their hijacked schooner, for a quick getaway through the Sun Gates.\nIn almost every case, only once they and their accomplices were safely over the horizon were their crimes even discovered—usually along with one of Twisted Fate’s trademark calling cards left where it would be easily found.\nDuring a heist that rapidly turned from complex to completely botched, Graves was taken by the local enforcers, while Twisted Fate merely turned tail and abandoned him.\nThrown into the infamous prison known as the Locker, Graves endured years of torture and solitary confinement, during which time he nursed his bitter anger toward his old partner, and, convinced that Twisted Fate had betrayed him, Graves was determined to have his revenge.\nWhen he finally clawed his way to freedom, with the prison warden’s brand new shotgun slung over his shoulder, Graves began his long-overdue pursuit of Twisted Fate.\nIn the years after, Twisted Fate continued conning people solo, one-time evading capture by Miss Fortune. She would later hire him by proxy to sneak into Gangplank’s warehouse to steal and return a Crimson-Coil dagger, where he would reunite with Graves, who broke out from The Locker and was tipped off by the Bounty Hunter herself about Twisted Fate presence.\nFlamed with rage at his partner's apparent betrayal, Graves started shooting at Tobias in an effort to settle the score with him. With Gangplank's warehouse burning and with the pirate captain's thugs swarming, the resolution of Graves' and Twisted Fate's long-simmering feud threatens to engulf the entire city in flames. Informed by the destruction of his warehouse, Gangplank set off the catch both of the perpetrators of this act.\nBoth Graves and Twisted Fate tried to flee from the wrath of the Pirate King but with no success. Gangplank tortured them until he tried to publicly execute them in front of the whole city for their misbehavior. Hearing the news of this event, Sarah Fortune's plans set in motion and along with her crew, started to make preparations to blow up Gangplank’s flagship so all Bilgewater could witness the death of their Reaver King.\nGraves managed to hide one of Twisted Fate's cards, snatched during their previous fight around the city, from the pirate thugs, and so, Twisted Fate teleports behind Gangplank and punches him, but Graves gets dragged to the bottom of the ocean. Twisted Fate then jumps after him and saves Graves from drowning but almost dies in the process. Graves manages to save Twisted Fate and after they successfully survive the explosion, both men settled their dispute and resolve to pick up their joint hustling.\nAs Graves had lost his shotgun Destiny, they head to Piltover so he can get a new one. Even though Graves and Twisted Fate are tempted to reconcile their relationship, both know it may take a while for Graves to completely trust Twisted Fate again, still, the latter is happy to have his old friend back.\nAfter running jobs in Piltover and Zaun for a while, they go back to Bilgewater in search of the Abyssal Crown. Along with the story, Twisted Fate actively tries to regain Graves' trust, staying despite the danger and giving the Crown to Graves since the latter still keeps some distance from him.\nThey end up angering a sea witch in the process. Later on Miss Fortune springs a trap for Twisted Fate and Graves. Despite the latter's success in cornering her, she manages to trap them and hand them to the sea witch in exchange for her quartermaster. In the end, she helps Twisted Fate and Graves escape as well.\nGraves is a gruff-looking, broad-shouldered, middle-aged man. He has fair skin, dark brown hair, and brown eyes. He typically wears his hair swept back and his beard in a mustache-and-mutton-chops combo with only his chin shaved, though he has also been seen with a full beard.\nHe generally wears simple, practical attire, such as a blue shirt and dark brown pants with leather boots and gloves. He wears a number of belts and pouches on his waist, visibly holding shotgun shells. He is also known to wear a blood-red cowl over his shoulders and back.\nHis signature weapon, Destiny, is an oversized double-barreled shotgun made of black, gold, and brown metal. It houses a glass chamber which glows with orange-yellow energy.\nGraves has a free-spirited and hot-tempered personality. His incredibly reckless nature and tendency to commit acts such as stealing and gambling has led to him becoming a wanted criminal in almost every city in existence. More then anything Graves values loyalty and will do good by anyone who does good by him, especially his partner Twisted Fate .\nTheir partnership started when they recognized a kindred soul in one another across a table during a high-stakes game in Mudtown.\nThey both shared the same reckless passion for danger and adventure, which is what encouraged them to form their partnership. Graves being the brawn, and T.F. being the brains they were an unusually effective team from the outset. Their mutual sense of roguish honor grew into genuine trust, and together they hustled across Valoran.\nThey were forced apart when a heist went south, with Graves getting sent to The Locker despite Twisted Fate’s efforts to save him.\nGraves endured years of torture and solitary confinement, during which time he nursed his bitter anger toward his old partner, and, convinced T.F. had betrayed him, Graves was determined to have his revenge.\nGraves reunited with T.F. again when MIss Fortune set them up, yet they were forced to put aside their differences in order to escape almost certain death in the ongoing conflict between her and Gangplank.\nEven though Graves and T.F. were tempted to reconcile their relationship, both knew it may take a while for Graves to completely trust T.F. again, still, the latter was happy to have his old friend back.\nStill, since Graves still kept some distance from T.F., in the short story Destiny and Fate, T.F. proactively tries to show Graves that he can trust him again. T.F. had a history of taking off when things got ugly and so, T.F. wanted to stay and retrieve the Abyssal Crown even if it meant risking his life so he could prove to Graves that he wouldn't leave him to pick up the pieces anymore. In the same story, when Graves shows up next to T.F. bleeding, the latter notices and expresses his concern, something that Graves actually appreciated even if he didn't say it out loud.\nDuring the Burning Tides events, T.F. jumps after Graves to save him from drowning despite not knowing how to swim and being terrified of drowning himself.\nGraves seems to like messing with T.F., particularly by calling him Tobias instead of Twisted Fate insisting the latter is a stupid name, or by splashing him with salt water just to mess with TF's carefully oiled and perfumed hair. Similarly, T.F. usually comes up with clever replies to annoy Graves. Their petty bickering is seen many times like at the end of Burning Tides' Act 4, Double-double cross, and Destiny and Fate.\nAfter some time, Graves captured Teemo for the bounty on yordles while Twisted Fate refuses because \"messing with Yordles brings a whole heap of trouble.\" He then fought Corki , Lulu and Tristana who came to save Teemo, which ended up in Graves being turned into a frog and the Yordles escaping.\nGraves respects Vayne for being the only person among the Sentinels of Light to stand up to him."}

Viego took Isolde's corpse to the Blessed Isles in hopes of reviving her, but unleashed ruination instead. Without their king, the nation of Camavor would crumble and Gwen would be forgotten for centuries.\nGwen would eventually find herself on the Shadow Isles when Viego was awakened by Gangplank and Thresh . Viego would be defeated by Ahri , Braum , Illaoi , Miss Fortune , Pyke , and Yasuo and imprisoned within an amulet. The Ruined King would somehow escape the amulet and resume his search for his queen. The fragments of Isolde's soul scattered across Runeterra and imbued themselves into various fetters, one of them being Gwen. Gwen would be brought to life by the fragment of Isolde's soul and found herself with an oversized pair of scissors, needles, and thread. She would soon be attacked by a swarm of wraiths and remembered the pain associated with Viego, she quickly dispatched the wraiths and knew that they were tied with him. Fascinated by the wonders of life, Gwen would set out to explore the world and stop the pain caused by Viego and the Black Mist.\nGwen was watching children play from afar, while she was protected from the Black Mist. The Black Mist threatens to attack the children's house so Gwen unhesitatingly undoes her Hallowed Mist and begins to purge the specters of the Black Mist to protect the children.\nRight after the children's mother appears and thanks her, Gwen observes the mother's hands and sees several calluses and wounds. The mother was a seamstress and made dolls for her children to play with, so Gwen felt the affection that Isolde had when creating and sewing her.\nGwen then understands that her creator's true magic was love.\nGwen soon found herself at the Sentinels of Light's headquarters where she would meet Lucian , Senna and a Rookie. She aided them in repelling a swarm of wraiths and joined them in stopping Viego's global harrowing. She would travel with the Sentinels across Runeterra, chasing after the other fetters and repelling Viego's attacks. Along the way, the Sentinels would recruit more fighters into their ranks and Gwen would give haircuts and tailor new uniforms for Diana , Graves , Irelia , Olaf , Pyke , Rengar , Riven , and Vayne . When Viego obtained most of the fetters, the Sentinels launched one last assault against him on the Shadow Isles. Gwen attempted to bind him within the Hallowed Mist, but Viego quickly dispatched her with a stroke of his blade. He took her, Senna and the Maiden of the Mist to Camavor to resurrect Isolde. Viego tore the fragment of Isolde's soul within Gwen, killing her and the other fetters, and revived his queen.  Isolde was horrified at what Viego had done and rejected him. She prompted Akshan to kill her with his Absolver and revived Gwen, Senna and the Maiden. Gwen then was able to seal him within the Hallowed Mist and the threat of the Ruined King was over. Gwen reckoned with Senna about Isolde being truly gone now, but was ready to live her life to the fullest.\nAfter some time, Gwen continued to clear the black mist on the Shadow Isles . As she made her way through the Black Mist , she found an opulent mansion in the shadowy woods. As she investigated, Gwen discovered that it was home to the Midnight Revel, a grand ball hosted by friendly spirits, whom invited her in as their guest of honor. She attended the party, protecting it from the Black Mist and dancing the night away.\nGwen has the appearance of a pale young woman of medium stature. Her hair is blue and curled up in two long ringlets that are decorated with dark blue ribbons. On her neck and arms she has magical blue marks resembling the stitches of a doll in the same way when she was a normal doll. Her eyes have cross shaped pupils, resembling buttons, with the one on the left being blue and the one on the right being pink.\nGwen typically dresses In a white dress with a black rim and blue chest, decorated with golden details.\nGwen is a doll given life by the Hallowed Mist and a fragment of Isolde's soul, representing her kindness, love and joy, granting her self awareness and a independent personality.\nHaving being created as an idealized character by Isolde as a little girl, Gwen has the personality of a idealized princess of fairy tales, highly polite and graceful. She's kind, friendly, and excitable, eager to see the world,  curious and in love of everything in it. Having been alive for only a short time, she is terrified of dying.\nAlthough generally friendly and genuine in her niceness, Gwen is not unaware of the darkness of the world. She dutifully fights the evils of the Black Mist to protect the world she was born in, and she has nothing but contempt for the Shadow Isles 's most  malevolent members, such as Thresh and Viego .\nGwen was created by Isolde , Viego's wife. After being brought to life, Gwen uses Isolde's tools. Gwen also contains a fragment of Isolde's soul, like Senna .\nGwen travels across Runeterra to fight Viego and the Mist as well as to help people in need.\nDuring the events of Rise of the Sentinels , Gwen accompanied the Sentinels of Light in the fight against the Black Mist and Viego. She worked as the team' hair stylist and tailor.\nGwen and the 4 Ghostly Paramour seem to have memories of and feelings for each other, both say they've seen each other before but don't remember exactly when. 4 Ghostly Paramour is likely a reference to 6 Viego ; a perfect version of the imperfect man she once knew."}

When the Blessed Isles fell into shadow , this proud knight was undone by the destructive energies of the Ruination of Helia , along with all his cavalry and their mounts. Now, whenever The Black Mist reaches out across Runeterra , he leads its devastating charge, reveling in the slaughter and crushing foes beneath his armored hooves.\nIn life, Hecarim had been a lieutenant of the Iron Order, charged with protecting the lands owned by King Viego of Camavor .  Due to his many victories in battle, the Knight-Commander of the Order had considered Hecarim as a potential candidate to succeed him and lead the Order some day, but when the Commander realized Hecarim's growing darkness and lust for personal glory, he concluded that Hecarim should never lead the Order.  On being told of this decision by the Commander, Hecarim was furious, but returned to his duties with the Order.\nDuring the Order's next battle, Hecarim found the Commander surrounded by enemies and cut off from reinforcements.  Hecarim chose to turn away and leave his commander to die.  After the battle, the Iron Order swore allegiance to Hecarim, unaware of his involvement in their fallen commander's death.\nOn his way to be officially sworn in as the new Knight-Commander of the Iron Order, Hecarim met General Kalista .  The General was on a desperate mission to find a cure for the Queen, who had been poisoned by an assassin.  The King, overcome by paranoia and seeing traitors everywhere, sent the Iron Order and its new Commander to quell all dissent within Camavor.  The Order put hundreds to death and burned entire towns.  Eventually, the Queen died, presenting a new opportunity for Hecarim to advance his brutal reputation.  He proposed that the King should deploy the Order to attack Camavor's foreign enemies to avenge the murdered Queen.\nThe King agreed, but while the Order was preparing to ride against the kingdom's enemies, General Kalista returned, having found the antidote to the poison on the Blessed Isles .  Furious that his general had come too late to save his wife, the King had Kalista thrown in a cell.  Hecarim, curious about her journey, went to visit the general.  He learned of the Blessed Isles, concealed by thick, white mist and home to incredible riches — including the Waters of Life, which may yet be able to heal the Queen.\nHecarim convinced the King to release Kalista so she could lead a fleet back to the Blessed Isles, as she was the only one who could find the way.  Soon, Kalista, Hecarim, the Iron Order, and King Viego himself all landed at the Blessed Isles' city of Helia , along with the body of the dead Queen.  The expedition marched toward the city, but were was stopped by the city's leaders, who refused to help.  At this, the King ordered Kalista to kill the leaders of Helia.  When Kalista refused, Hecarim seized yet another opportunity.  He stabbed the general through the back with spear and gave the command for the Order to pillage and plunder the city.\nIn the ensuing havoc, a common custodian agree to give access to the Waters, but Hecarim was too consumed by greed and bloodlust to listen. During the continued ransacking of Helia, an enormous magical shockwave exploded across the city, destroying every building.  After the explosion subsided, a whirling storm of The Black Mist tore through the ruined city, engulfing all in its path.  Hecarim called for a retreat, but it was too late.  Every member of the Iron Order was consumed by the Mist, ending with Hecarim himself.  When the Mist took him, it permanently merged Hecarim with his warhorse.  He is. now an Undead monster; a living engine of wrath.  He is damned to endlessly patrol the now-renamed Shadow Isles , unable to leave except during an event known as a Harrowing , when the Black Mist rolls out to find new souls to join the army of Undead.\nHecarim is an armored centaur-like wraith with a humanoid upper half and an equine lower half, as a result of him fusing with his horse after transforming into a wraith. His body is composed of metallic armor, connected by a glowing spectral body with visible hooves and tail. His head is a samurai-like helmet with an axe-like crest and skull-like teeth on its mouth. His chestplate and horse armor have skull-like faces adorning them, and has a tattered banner beneath the horse's chest. He is often seen wielding his glaive.\nAs mentioned when touched by Nagakaboros' powers, Hecarim's appearance as a human was described as being tall and handsome, with silver and gold armor and having dark eyes.\nHecarim is a merciless, bloodthirsty warrior who enjoys raiding cities and killing their inhabitants, mainly to gain a reputation of being feared or simply pure sadism, shown when he was so caught up with slaughtering the Helians that the Ruination took him by surprise. He is obsessed with glory and has no problem with killing his own allies to further climb up the ranks. Hecarim can also be cunning and manipulative to get what he wants, pushing Viego's grief into becoming more unhinged so he could raid enemy settlements on his command, and persuading Kalista to reveal the Blessed Isles for him. After becoming a wraith, he now seeks to kill every mortal being he comes across with the Iron Order by his side.\nHecarim is a member of the Iron Order which vowed to protect the king's land, but he does not respect Viego and only follows him as he allows to pillage lands.\nHecarim is being hunted by Kalista for his betrayal and for helping unleash the Ruination of the Blessed Isles, thus turning them into the Shadow Isles and its denizens into Undead abominations.\nHecarim faced Miss Fortune and Illaoi during one of the Black Mist's attack on Bilgewater but was driven back when Illaoi channeled her god's power."}

He proposed that the King should deploy the Order to attack Camavor's foreign enemies to avenge the murdered Queen.\nThe King agreed, but while the Order was preparing to ride against the kingdom's enemies, General Kalista returned, having found the antidote to the poison on the Blessed Isles .  Furious that his general had come too late to save his wife, the King had Kalista thrown in a cell.  Hecarim, curious about her journey, went to visit the general.  He learned of the Blessed Isles, concealed by thick, white mist and home to incredible riches — including the Waters of Life, which may yet be able to heal the Queen.\nHecarim convinced the King to release Kalista so she could lead a fleet back to the Blessed Isles, as she was the only one who could find the way.  Soon, Kalista, Hecarim, the Iron Order, and King Viego himself all landed at the Blessed Isles' city of Helia , along with the body of the dead Queen.  The expedition marched toward the city, but were was stopped by the city's leaders, who refused to help.  At this, the King ordered Kalista to kill the leaders of Helia.  When Kalista refused, Hecarim seized yet another opportunity.  He stabbed the general through the back with spear and gave the command for the Order to pillage and plunder the city.\nIn the ensuing havoc, a common custodian agree to give access to the Waters, but Hecarim was too consumed by greed and bloodlust to listen. During the continued ransacking of Helia, an enormous magical shockwave exploded across the city, destroying every building.  After the explosion subsided, a whirling storm of The Black Mist tore through the ruined city, engulfing all in its path.  Hecarim called for a retreat, but it was too late.  Every member of the Iron Order was consumed by the Mist, ending with Hecarim himself.  When the Mist took him, it permanently merged Hecarim with his warhorse.  He is. now an Undead monster; a living engine of wrath.  He is damned to endlessly patrol the now-renamed Shadow Isles , unable to leave except during an event known as a Harrowing , when the Black Mist rolls out to find new souls to join the army of Undead.\nHecarim is an armored centaur-like wraith with a humanoid upper half and an equine lower half, as a result of him fusing with his horse after transforming into a wraith. His body is composed of metallic armor, connected by a glowing spectral body with visible hooves and tail. His head is a samurai-like helmet with an axe-like crest and skull-like teeth on its mouth. His chestplate and horse armor have skull-like faces adorning them, and has a tattered banner beneath the horse's chest. He is often seen wielding his glaive.\nAs mentioned when touched by Nagakaboros' powers, Hecarim's appearance as a human was described as being tall and handsome, with silver and gold armor and having dark eyes.\nHecarim is a merciless, bloodthirsty warrior who enjoys raiding cities and killing their inhabitants, mainly to gain a reputation of being feared or simply pure sadism, shown when he was so caught up with slaughtering the Helians that the Ruination took him by surprise. He is obsessed with glory and has no problem with killing his own allies to further climb up the ranks. Hecarim can also be cunning and manipulative to get what he wants, pushing Viego's grief into becoming more unhinged so he could raid enemy settlements on his command, and persuading Kalista to reveal the Blessed Isles for him. After becoming a wraith, he now seeks to kill every mortal being he comes across with the Iron Order by his side.\nHecarim is a member of the Iron Order which vowed to protect the king's land, but he does not respect Viego and only follows him as he allows to pillage lands.\nHecarim is being hunted by Kalista for his betrayal and for helping unleash the Ruination of the Blessed Isles, thus turning them into the Shadow Isles and its denizens into Undead abominations.\nHecarim faced Miss Fortune and Illaoi during one of the Black Mist's attack on Bilgewater but was driven back when Illaoi channeled her god's power."}

Beneath his melancholy roils a torn, emotional mind— haunted by both the vibrant visions of his imagination and the gruesome memories of his temple's massacre. Hwei seeks to understand this light and dark, which drives him inevitably toward the artist who unraveled him. With paintbrush and palette, Hwei shapes endless possibilities as he draws ever closer to earning closure or embracing despair.\nBorn into a legacy, Hwei was destined to inherit the Temple of Koyehn . He spent his childhood immersed in the vibrant surroundings, translating his wild daydreams onto canvas. From a young age, it was evident that his visions were not mere reflections of reality; instead, they were fantastical interpretations that turned life itself into art.\nHwei's unique connection with the world manifested not only in his paintings but also in the shifting hues of his eyes, mirroring the ebb and flow of his mind and mood. The temple's art form, paint magic, became Hwei's chosen medium, a medium that influenced the emotions of its audience. However, strict control and discipline were necessary to prevent the art from overpowering mental perceptions and bodily sensations, as those who failed to control it were banished from Koyehn.\nDespite the strict precepts, Hwei, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to explore the depths of his power, indulged his imagination. In a pivotal moment, during a demonstration for the temple masters, Hwei's control wavered as he painted Koyehn's sea. Emotions crashed over him, and he surrendered to the beauty of his creation. This awakening infuriated the temple masters who, while unwilling to exile the heir, stressed the weight of his responsibilities. Hwei, haunted yet fascinated by the depths of his power, continued to push the boundaries in secret at night.\nThe tranquil existence of Koyehn was disrupted when Khada Jhin visited the temple. A bond formed between Hwei and Jhin, as they exchanged creative perspectives. However, the night before Jhin departed, he challenged Hwei, sensing the façade in the pieces he presented to the world. Reluctantly, Hwei unleashed his true art, revealing decades of suppressed emotions and imagination. Jhin, witnessing the forbidden visions, departed with an ominous farewell, stating he would move on tomorrow \"to watch the lotuses bloom.\"\nAt dawn, Hwei awoke to a series of tragedies. Four historic paintings lay destroyed, the four masters who berated Hwei in his youth lay dead, and the temple itself erupted in flames. In the chaos, Hwei recognized the dark potential of his art for destruction and torment, realizing the horror and fascination that had gripped him in his youth.\nAs the temple collapsed into ruins, Hwei emerged as the sole survivor, haunted by guilt and the overwhelming power of his own imagination. By day, he mourned with the villagers, but by night, he revisited the wreckage, using his paintbrush and palette to create scenes that captured the essence of Koyehn's crest—the same crest worn over his heart.\nDiscovering a lotus-shaped trap amid the rubble, Hwei pieced together the perpetrator was none other than the artist he grew so close to. The thought unleashed a cascade of emotions—fear, sorrow, betrayal, and awe. Faced with a choice between staying with his people or pursuing the answers to the tragedy, Hwei, bearing only his paintbrush and palette, left Koyehn behind.\nIn the time since, Hwei has embarked on a journey of self-discovery and redemption. He seeks answers by revealing the full extent of his art, tracking down nefarious individuals in the darkest corners of Ionia . As he spirals deeper into the shadows, Hwei lights a path, his mind brimming with possibility.\nHwei is a slender man with pale olive skin and wavy, dark teal hair, usually parted to the left. His eyes change color based on his mood. [ 2 ] He wears a shade of dark aqua eyeshadow. [ 3 ] He tends to wear simple, comfortable clothes, such as calf-length pants, a loose-fitting tunic, and slip-on shoes. This outfit contrasts dark, muted tones of teal with splashes of bright orange. At least his right ear is pierced in two places (his left ear is obscured by his hair). He is often seen carrying a massive paintbrush, comparable in size to a staff, and with a trail of paints levitating behind him.\nHwei is in conflict with his own duality. Beneath his kind and compassionate nature lies an insatiable curiosity, driving an imagination that blurs reality and fantasy. The internal conflict within him, torn between the light of redemption and the shadows of guilt, shapes his interactions. Hwei's emotional palette, unpredictable and intense, defines not only his art but also the complex relationships he navigates. In his journey through Ionia's darkest corners, he seeks answers and redemption, wielding his magical paintbrush to bring solace and reflection to others and himself.\nHwei's encounter with Khada Jhin was a pivotal turning point in his life. During Jhin's visit to Koyehn, the two exchanged creative perspectives, with Hwei guiding Jhin through the beauty of his home. There was a mutual respect for their differences, as Hwei recognized Jhin's virtuosity. However, the night before Jhin's departure, the dynamic shifted. Jhin, sensing the façade in Hwei's presented art, challenged him to reveal a genuine performance. Reluctantly, Hwei unleashed the true power of his art, revealing decades of suppressed emotions. Jhin, witnessing the forbidden visions, left with an inscrutable farewell. The consequences of that night echoed through Koyehn, leaving Hwei to grapple with the aftermath of tragedy. The encounter with Jhin left an indelible mark on Hwei's path, influencing the conflicting hues within him."}

Beneath his melancholy roils a torn, emotional mind— haunted by both the vibrant visions of his imagination and the gruesome memories of his temple's massacre. Hwei seeks to understand this light and dark, which drives him inevitably toward the artist who unraveled him. With paintbrush and palette, Hwei shapes endless possibilities as he draws ever closer to earning closure or embracing despair.\nBorn into a legacy, Hwei was destined to inherit the Temple of Koyehn . He spent his childhood immersed in the vibrant surroundings, translating his wild daydreams onto canvas. From a young age, it was evident that his visions were not mere reflections of reality; instead, they were fantastical interpretations that turned life itself into art.\nHwei's unique connection with the world manifested not only in his paintings but also in the shifting hues of his eyes, mirroring the ebb and flow of his mind and mood. The temple's art form, paint magic, became Hwei's chosen medium, a medium that influenced the emotions of its audience. However, strict control and discipline were necessary to prevent the art from overpowering mental perceptions and bodily sensations, as those who failed to control it were banished from Koyehn.\nDespite the strict precepts, Hwei, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to explore the depths of his power, indulged his imagination. In a pivotal moment, during a demonstration for the temple masters, Hwei's control wavered as he painted Koyehn's sea. Emotions crashed over him, and he surrendered to the beauty of his creation. This awakening infuriated the temple masters who, while unwilling to exile the heir, stressed the weight of his responsibilities. Hwei, haunted yet fascinated by the depths of his power, continued to push the boundaries in secret at night.\nThe tranquil existence of Koyehn was disrupted when Khada Jhin visited the temple. A bond formed between Hwei and Jhin, as they exchanged creative perspectives. However, the night before Jhin departed, he challenged Hwei, sensing the façade in the pieces he presented to the world. Reluctantly, Hwei unleashed his true art, revealing decades of suppressed emotions and imagination. Jhin, witnessing the forbidden visions, departed with an ominous farewell, stating he would move on tomorrow \"to watch the lotuses bloom.\"\nAt dawn, Hwei awoke to a series of tragedies. Four historic paintings lay destroyed, the four masters who berated Hwei in his youth lay dead, and the temple itself erupted in flames. In the chaos, Hwei recognized the dark potential of his art for destruction and torment, realizing the horror and fascination that had gripped him in his youth.\nAs the temple collapsed into ruins, Hwei emerged as the sole survivor, haunted by guilt and the overwhelming power of his own imagination. By day, he mourned with the villagers, but by night, he revisited the wreckage, using his paintbrush and palette to create scenes that captured the essence of Koyehn's crest—the same crest worn over his heart.\nDiscovering a lotus-shaped trap amid the rubble, Hwei pieced together the perpetrator was none other than the artist he grew so close to. The thought unleashed a cascade of emotions—fear, sorrow, betrayal, and awe. Faced with a choice between staying with his people or pursuing the answers to the tragedy, Hwei, bearing only his paintbrush and palette, left Koyehn behind.\nIn the time since, Hwei has embarked on a journey of self-discovery and redemption. He seeks answers by revealing the full extent of his art, tracking down nefarious individuals in the darkest corners of Ionia . As he spirals deeper into the shadows, Hwei lights a path, his mind brimming with possibility.\nHwei is a slender man with pale olive skin and wavy, dark teal hair, usually parted to the left. His eyes change color based on his mood. [ 2 ] He wears a shade of dark aqua eyeshadow. [ 3 ] He tends to wear simple, comfortable clothes, such as calf-length pants, a loose-fitting tunic, and slip-on shoes. This outfit contrasts dark, muted tones of teal with splashes of bright orange. At least his right ear is pierced in two places (his left ear is obscured by his hair). He is often seen carrying a massive paintbrush, comparable in size to a staff, and with a trail of paints levitating behind him.\nHwei is in conflict with his own duality. Beneath his kind and compassionate nature lies an insatiable curiosity, driving an imagination that blurs reality and fantasy. The internal conflict within him, torn between the light of redemption and the shadows of guilt, shapes his interactions. Hwei's emotional palette, unpredictable and intense, defines not only his art but also the complex relationships he navigates. In his journey through Ionia's darkest corners, he seeks answers and redemption, wielding his magical paintbrush to bring solace and reflection to others and himself.\nHwei's encounter with Khada Jhin was a pivotal turning point in his life. During Jhin's visit to Koyehn, the two exchanged creative perspectives, with Hwei guiding Jhin through the beauty of his home. There was a mutual respect for their differences, as Hwei recognized Jhin's virtuosity. However, the night before Jhin's departure, the dynamic shifted. Jhin, sensing the façade in Hwei's presented art, challenged him to reveal a genuine performance. Reluctantly, Hwei unleashed the true power of his art, revealing decades of suppressed emotions. Jhin, witnessing the forbidden visions, left with an inscrutable farewell. The consequences of that night echoed through Koyehn, leaving Hwei to grapple with the aftermath of tragedy. The encounter with Jhin left an indelible mark on Hwei's path, influencing the conflicting hues within him."}

Trained in the ancient dances of her province, she adapted her art for war, using the graceful and carefully practised movements to levitate a host of deadly blades. After proving herself as a fighter, she was thrust into the role of resistance leader and figurehead, and to this day remains dedicated to the preservation of her homeland.\nWhen she was young, she was fascinated by the grace and beauty of human movement. Under her grandmother’s tutelage, she learned the traditional silk dances of her province—though she was dubious of their supposedly mystical connection to the Spirit of Ionia, Irelia’s love for the dances was real. Seeking to master the art, she eventually left home to study with some of Ionia’s most respected performers at the Placidium of Navori.\nIrelia’s people were peaceful and sought harmony with their neighbors, but rumors of foreign invaders sighted off the coast unsettled many at the Placidium. Irelia returned to her village to find it already occupied, with steel-helmed soldiers from distant Noxus shoving unarmed civilians through the streets with the butts of their spears. The Noxian Admiral Duqal had seized the Xan home to quarter his fleet officers.\nIrelia’s brothers and her father Lito had evidently protested; her entire family now lay in unmarked graves, in the gardens.\nRavaged by grief, the young girl saw Duqal’s men hauling valuables from the house. Among the loot was a large metal crest, depicting the Xan family emblem. Irelia raced to it, wrenching it from Noxian hands. The admiral himself hurled her to the ground, and had his warriors shatter the crest with a heavy iron maul, before ordering them to dig a fresh grave for this upstart child.\nAs they surrounded her, Irelia averted her eyes, looking to the pieces of the Xan crest scattered on the ground. From deep within her soul, she felt a strange rhythm begin to beat. The shards of metal began to twitch, to twist, moving seemingly on their own, and Irelia felt the serene joy of the ancient dances once more...\nWith a sweep of her arm, she sent the pieces flying like ragged blades, cutting clean through two of the Noxians. As Duqal and his officers reeled in shock, Irelia snatched up the shards of her crest, and fled the village.\nIn the quiet forests beyond, Irelia mourned her family, and thought back to her grandmother’s teachings. She realized that the techniques she had learned were more than mere dances—they were a powerful expression of something far greater.\nThe Noxian occupation soon began to test the fragile peace of the First Lands. It was said that even the religious leader Karma had been forced to strike back at the invaders with deadly magic, though her followers had now withdrawn to the Lasting Altar and would not condone any further violence. Across Navori, dissenting voices began to band together. A resistance was forming, one that would not rest until Ionia was free once more. Irelia joined their ranks, performing her cherished dances for them in the woodland camps, to preserve some vestige of their vanishing culture.\nShe was barely fourteen years old when she found herself back at the Placidium. Her band of resistance fighters joined the militia who had sworn to guard the monasteries and wild, sacred gardens.\nBut Noxus knew only too well what this place represented. A particularly cunning general named Jericho Swain captured the Placidium and took its defenders hostage, hoping to lure the inevitable reinforcements into a trap.\nIt was in this moment that Irelia rose to meet her destiny. Freed from her bonds, she unleashed the full potential of her ancient blade dance, lashing out with graceful zeal. A dozen of Swain’s veterans fell, sowing chaos in their ranks as the other captives joined her, before she struck down the general himself—the sight of this rebellious girl hefting his severed arm over her head would be the turning point of the war.\nThis victory, the Great Stand at Navori, ensured that everyone in Ionia knew the name of Xan Irelia, and looked to her for leadership. Reluctantly, she led the growing resistance for almost three years of grueling battle before her triumph at Dalu Bay. There, she finally cornered the defeated Admiral Duqal, and exacted the vengeance she had sought for so long.\nThough the war has long since ended, Ionia has been permanently changed by it. The First Lands are now divided, with rival factions fighting each other almost as bitterly as they did the Noxians. Many continue to look to Irelia for answers but, while others might welcome such power, Irelia remains uneasy with it.\nAt heart, she still yearns only to dance alone.\nWhen the sentinels arrived in Ionia they found Irelia, she was reluctant with the strangers and appeared willing to face them, especially after seeing Riven among them.\nIrelia is a slender, pale-skinned woman with long dark hair up to the hips and sea green eyes . Her robes are a mix of elegant robes and battle attire with a distinctive palette of red, pink, black and silver. The most characteristic ornaments of her attire are the silver diadem on her head. She also has several 1 silver blades that float around it.\nIrelia is a passionate, protective and very fond of dance individual who dedicates herself to the protection of Ionia. She believes that brute force is needed to properly defend Ionia from the likes of Noxus, hence why she considers alliances with Zed and his shadow assassins due to their similar beliefs. She also demonstrates a kind and caring persona to those close to her, such as the Blossoming Blade, whom she has a soft spot for.\nDespite her uptight and serious demeanour, however, Irelia also displays a level of sarcasm at her opponents, evidenced by her comments on Garen's fighting technique and his habit of yelling his country's name in battle.\nIrelia cut off Swain's arm which resulted in him contacting and taming a demon of secrets named Raum and then become the Grand General of Noxus, for such reason he is somewhat grateful for her action.\nIrelia was heavily antagonistic towards Riven , due to her past actions during the Noxian Invasion, but grew to respect her during their time together as Sentinels of Light.\nSona's in-game voice lines suggest she and Irelia met at some point when she returned to Ionia.\nThe Ionian resistance led by Irelia in the war was later sprung into different groups with different ideologies, including the Navori Brotherhood and the Navovi Militia. The Brotherhood in particular became more aggressive when she wasn't the hardcore leader they needed and has tried to kill her multiple times. [ 1 ]\nIrelia dislikes those with more pacifist attitude like Karma and Ivern or those who do not protect their homeland like the Kinkou Order since in her belief it would only lead to the fall of Ionia. She may also be willing to side with Ionian extremists like Zed , his order and even the Navori Brotherhood if necessary despite not approving their method. [ 2 ]\nAs told in Legends of Runeterra , her resistance force include peasants of Ionia, musicians and dancers. Among those, Irelia appears to have the most intimate relationship with 5 Liana ."}

He knows all the secrets of the natural world, and holds deep friendships with things that grow, fly, and scuttle. Ivern enriches the forests, imparts strange wisdom to any mortal he meets, and occasionally entrusts loose-lipped butterflies with his secrets.\nIvern the Cruel was a renowned warlord of ancient Vorrijaard , following the ways of the warlike old gods , including the Volibear , in spite of the new Three Sisters . Though the armies of the Three Sisters was enhanced by dark magic and could not be beaten by any normal means. Ivern and his clan plotted on how best to take down the Iceborn , eventually they settled on sailing east, towards where all magic flows from, to harvest said magic for himself. Unbeknownst to them, once they had set sail, they would never be seen in Vorrijaard again.\nAs Ivern and his tribe landed on Ionia and conquered their way through a dozen coastal settlements, they discovered a sacred grove, Omikayalan or \"the Heart of the World\". Ivern was attacked by many Vastayans , trying to drive away Ivern and his tribe from their sacred grove, but Ivern continued, slaying anyone who stood in his way. This continued until finally he had arrived at the legendary God-Willow , a colossal tree with gossamer leaves, shimmering of gold. He realised this had to be what the Vastaya were trying to protect so he took up his axe and struck down the God-Willow. As the tree fell, Ivern the Cruel disapeared with it.\nIvern saw bursts of life from the death and destruction he had caused, and he found it oddly beautiful. As he reflected on himself, he noticed his body had changed; he was taller and with longer limbs, rough with bark and leaves. Suddenly he started hearing the very land around him crying and Ivern felt a sudden rush of remorse and sadness over what he had done. As Ivern cried out in sadness, he noticed that somehow, a unfathomable long time had passed, the world felt new and the sadness and violence he once felt as Ivern the Cruel had disapeared. Ivern was a completely different person now, one who enjoyed communicating with the various flora and fauna, rivers and dirt, developing close friendships with the forest creatures and offering a helping hand where he could. He realized that he now bore the God-Willow's legacy, to cultivate and help humanity grow into something beautiful.\nIvern is a thin being, as tall as a tree. Iverns entire body is made out of living wood, with his legs thinning out into roots. His head is made of a pale wood with various moss and mushrooms growing from it. His head spirals outwards into two large portrusions, giving the appearance of two great horns, almost resembling an old Freljordian helmet, a remnant from his former life. From his head, leaves grow in places where his hair would normaly be, giving him a lush beard, pair of eyebrows and a mane of hair behind his horns. On his right arm is a woven gauntlet with various moss and mushrooms growing from it. In his horns, across his roots and in his left arm, rings of gold still remain.\nIvern the Cruel was a fierce and ruthless warrior, following the traditions of the warlike old gods of the Freljord. Ivern the Green Father, however, is cheerful and whimsical in contrast. Deeply attuned to nature, he may appear strange and eccentric to humans. He is curious and benevolent, nurturing the growth of the natural world wherever he can find it. Those who seek to harm the denizens of the forest, however, will find that Ivern's magic can harm as well as help."}

He knows all the secrets of the natural world, and holds deep friendships with things that grow, fly, and scuttle. Ivern enriches the forests, imparts strange wisdom to any mortal he meets, and occasionally entrusts loose-lipped butterflies with his secrets.\nIvern the Cruel was a renowned warlord of ancient Vorrijaard , following the ways of the warlike old gods , including the Volibear , in spite of the new Three Sisters . Though the armies of the Three Sisters was enhanced by dark magic and could not be beaten by any normal means. Ivern and his clan plotted on how best to take down the Iceborn , eventually they settled on sailing east, towards where all magic flows from, to harvest said magic for himself. Unbeknownst to them, once they had set sail, they would never be seen in Vorrijaard again.\nAs Ivern and his tribe landed on Ionia and conquered their way through a dozen coastal settlements, they discovered a sacred grove, Omikayalan or \"the Heart of the World\". Ivern was attacked by many Vastayans , trying to drive away Ivern and his tribe from their sacred grove, but Ivern continued, slaying anyone who stood in his way. This continued until finally he had arrived at the legendary God-Willow , a colossal tree with gossamer leaves, shimmering of gold. He realised this had to be what the Vastaya were trying to protect so he took up his axe and struck down the God-Willow. As the tree fell, Ivern the Cruel disapeared with it.\nIvern saw bursts of life from the death and destruction he had caused, and he found it oddly beautiful. As he reflected on himself, he noticed his body had changed; he was taller and with longer limbs, rough with bark and leaves. Suddenly he started hearing the very land around him crying and Ivern felt a sudden rush of remorse and sadness over what he had done. As Ivern cried out in sadness, he noticed that somehow, a unfathomable long time had passed, the world felt new and the sadness and violence he once felt as Ivern the Cruel had disapeared. Ivern was a completely different person now, one who enjoyed communicating with the various flora and fauna, rivers and dirt, developing close friendships with the forest creatures and offering a helping hand where he could. He realized that he now bore the God-Willow's legacy, to cultivate and help humanity grow into something beautiful.\nIvern is a thin being, as tall as a tree. Iverns entire body is made out of living wood, with his legs thinning out into roots. His head is made of a pale wood with various moss and mushrooms growing from it. His head spirals outwards into two large portrusions, giving the appearance of two great horns, almost resembling an old Freljordian helmet, a remnant from his former life. From his head, leaves grow in places where his hair would normaly be, giving him a lush beard, pair of eyebrows and a mane of hair behind his horns. On his right arm is a woven gauntlet with various moss and mushrooms growing from it. In his horns, across his roots and in his left arm, rings of gold still remain.\nIvern the Cruel was a fierce and ruthless warrior, following the traditions of the warlike old gods of the Freljord. Ivern the Green Father, however, is cheerful and whimsical in contrast. Deeply attuned to nature, he may appear strange and eccentric to humans. He is curious and benevolent, nurturing the growth of the natural world wherever he can find it. Those who seek to harm the denizens of the forest, however, will find that Ivern's magic can harm as well as help."}

While her presence is most often felt as a soothing breeze or a ferocious tempest, she also can manifest in corporeal form as an ethereal figure, comforting the downtrodden. Over the eons, Janna has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations. Through it all, she remains steadfast as a beacon of hope to those in need.\nMost of what is known about Janna is known through secondhand accounts and stories. Since ancient times, there were those who prayed to the winds. Some said that the winds would even answer sometimes. Seafarers said that they would spot a bright blue bird just before heavy winds, and others would say that they'd heard a whistling in the air right before a storm, as if to warn them of its approach. These stories spread and gained reverence among people all across Runeterra , with some saying that they had seen a bright blue bird transform into a woman with tapered ears and flowing hair. This mysterious figure was said to float above the water and direct the wind with a flick of her staff.\nThose that believed in these tales called this wind spirit \"Jan'ahrem\", an ancient Shuriman word meaning “guardian,” as she always seemed to appear in times of great need. As time went on, she became known more simply as Janna.\nThese tales spread across the Shuriman continent, with Janna's most faithful believers residing in what is now known as Zaun , as they needed calm seas for their city's port. These people made statues and shrines and regularly prayed to Janna, asking for calm seas and favorable winds. Despite decrees suppressing worship of false idols, Janna's devotees remained faithful, wearing amulets with the image of a blue bird in reverence for her.\nAfter the fall of the Shuriman empire, what was now the Shuriman deserts became enveloped in war. Despite this, Zaun remained untouched, as Janna shielded it from the turmoil.\nOver time, less and less people in Zaun prayed to Janna, instead becoming preoccupied with machines and advancing technology. However, one day, entire districts collapsed below sea level, and thousands had to fight for their lives against the currents of the River Pilt. This reignited faith in Janna, as the victims prayed to her for salvation and survival. Despite being forgotten for all this time, Janna helped the people. She used her wind magic not only to stop the water of the river from destroying homes so that people could evacuate, but also to quell smoke coming from fires so that people could see and breath better as they ran. While many died, those that survived saw what Janna did, and a belief and faithfulness to Janna was reignited within the Zaunite people, with her faithful once again wearing amulets reminiscent of blue birds and praying to her frequently.\nA Zaunite orphan prays to Janna. While he prays, he reflects on his life, including how difficult being a Zaunite is and how he is discriminated against because of his origins in the city. After an outburst of sadness, Janna appears behind the boy. She calms and hugs him, saying that it will be okay in the end. After comforting the boy, Janna throws a windy tornado on a piltovan citizen who had humiliated the boy, and this managed to get a smile from the little orphan.\nWhile caring for the needy of Zaun , Janna met Nilah and her crew and helped her face an ancient sea monster called 6 Lascylla , also known as the Figurehead of the Deep. Although Iascylla proved to be a worthy foe, the 6 Tidedancer eventually sailed close to the port city of Piltover and caught the attention of the spiritual goddess Janna , who used her powers over the winds to dispel Iascylla, protecting Nilah and pushing her away from Piltover's shores. [ 1 ]\nJanna is a Spirit God who takes the form of a slender woman with white skin, tapered ears and long, pale blonde hair waving over his head and light teal eyes. She wears light, sacred clothing with a white palette with some orange gemstones. The most distinctive ornament on her attire is the crown that appears to be crystal on her head. She also has a staff that appears to be crystal.\nJanna is a benevolent and mysterious individual, but is also extremely protective and caring towards those who believe in her and trust her guidance, she is true to her cause in helping those most in need.\nJanna has been the protective deity of Zaun since ancient times. While worship of her has diminished during Darkin and Rune Wars, she would once again be called upon after the Sun Gates disaster. Since then Janna has been called upon to clear the air of noxious pollution from the undercity, as well as be a supportive presence for zaunite inhabitants that require it."}

But when the Void was unleashed against the Shuriman empire 's Ascended Host, Icathia was destroyed, leaving Jax without a home or purpose.

He would tell Jax stories of the Kohari, a group of heroes who served the Mage King, the title given to the ruler of Icathia before it was taken over. The Mage King had resisted the Shuriman acquisition of Icathia, but he was defeated in battle. In his honor, the Kohari committed ritual suicide, as was customary for their order. The corpses of the Kohari and the Mage King were paraded around the city by the Empire for all to see as a warning of the consequences of resistance.\nSaijax's father passed down this resentment towards the Empire to his son, and Saijax started the study of arms, learning from Shurima's weapon masters and his clan's elders.\nOne day, a massive earthquake struck the coastal province of Saabera.

Once an Ionian prisoner, but freed by shadowy elements within Ionia's ruling council, the serial killer now works as their cabal's assassin. Using his gun as his paintbrush, Jhin creates works of artistic brutality, horrifying victims and onlookers. He gains a cruel pleasure from putting on his gruesome theater, making him the ideal choice to send the most powerful of messages: terror.\nJhin is assumed to have spent most of his life into early 20's on the Ionian province of Zhyun . Not much is known about his family life, except for his father's martial arts school. His father's career was snuffed out by the success of Wuju .\nJhin had been slaughtering farmsteads and scores of travelers for an unknown period of time before he was persued by Master Kusho , Usan , and Shen . He began his work in the ages spanning from 19-21, working primarily with knives. For a little more than four years, the three men pursued Jhin and were far from the first to have hunted him down. In the final stages of the three men's investigation, they discover that he is a mere stagehand working for Zhyun 's traveling theatre and opera houses under the name, \"Khada Jhin\". This is not his real name, the real one remains a mystery.\nMaster Kusho, Zed, and Shen followed Jhin's movements to Jyom Pass on the Ghajan river.  Zed chased Jhin down only to get knocked out by the handle of his blade. Jhin captured the young acolyte and tied him to a chair looking out towards the dock. Before Zed wakes up, Jhin takes the amulet off his neck. Zed wakes up to Jhin chiding him to look up, saying that he'll want to see Yevnai before she dies.  Jhin goes on about how boring and symmetrycal Yevnai's face is in contrast to the situation which was \"glorious\" . Zed begins to cry at seeing Yevnai on the dock before her \"final moments\".  After Jhin goes on about the tragic connections between Yevnai, Shen and Usan, the captive Zed begs for Jhin to not harm her, admitting that they were following him and noting that Yevnai, \"didn't do anything\". After saying he'll do anything, Jhin asks about the amulet that he took from Zed. Zed then concedes that it is a symbol of the Kinkou and that the amulet allows them to find him. Shen, presumably having found Zed, punches through the wall and pins Jhin's neck to the wall. Zed declares that the whole thing was a set-up, that he was the bait, and takes Jhin's 4th knife, lunging at the man to kill him. Master Kusho appears in the nick of time, saving Khada Jhin's life. [ 1 ] Kusho believes that because Jhin is not a real demon , he should be locked away at the monestary prison in Tuula .\nKhada Jhin was sentenced to life in the Tuula monestary prison. Jhin revealed as little about himself as possible during his many years there. The monks that guarded him said he was a \"bright student\". He excelled at a myriad of subjects, mostly in the arts, (i.e. smithing, poetry, and dance). Despite this, they could find nothing to cure him of his morbid fascinations. During his time in jail, the Noxian invasion began, and it is due to Ionia's instability during this time that his patrons funded him and released him from jail to terrorize the citizens of Ionia into action.\nJhin, post-Tuula, is freely roaming, bound only by his patrons. Those weaponizing Jhin include: the Kashuri Armories, as their weapons are relatively moderized for Ionia. Supposedly Jhin has also done performances for the Navori Brotherhood , Noxus , and most recently Zaun . Zed, when faced with Jhin's sniper rifle for the first time remarked that it was a \"foreigners weapon\". He has been described at this point in his life as both an assassin and an instrument of terror. [ 2 ]\nJhin was released some time after the war with Noxus. The timeline of his actions right after his release from prison is unclear, but he eventually sends a messenger out to Zed . She, the messenger, rows a small boat (with one of Jhin's lanterns on it!) out to the Kwol Tavern where she finds Master Zed and delivers him a message about a \"rich man\" wanting to meet him in the village north of the Thonx outskirts ; she gives Zed a blade attuned to his spirit wrapped in a red cloth which was the \"rich man's\" supposed thank-you-gift. [ 3 ] Jhin kills four people before the Order of Shadow arrive: two unidentified people, the messenger, and the woman whose leg was amputated by Zed and Kusho 16 years prior. This time span makes Jhin about 38 to 39 years old currently.\nJhin is a tall, slender, pale-skinned man. He has black hair and brown eyes (he is seen only using one, however his eyes are perfectly fine, he covers one because he enjoys the lack of depth during his \"performances\").\nHis most noticeable feature is his theater mask that he wears constantly when performing as Khada Jhin. It is implied that he has an average face that allows him to easily blend in when in a crowd. Typically, he wears a large white cloak  as well as elegant Ionian attire. He refers to his attire as his \"finery\" and at times uses the middle half of his gun as a cane to announce his presence and to rhythmically tap on the ground. [ 4 ]\nDespite his theatrics during murders, much of his day-to-day personality is reserved and quiet; it's not very memorable which he takes advantage of with his performances.

Jhin then encouraged the man to challenge himself, enabling Hwei to unleash decades of suppressed emotions within his art.\nAs the main reason for his imprisonment, Jhin holds some resentment towards the Kinkou master. However, after Kusho fakes his death with the help of Zed and becoming the leader of the Navori Brotherhood , Kusho unleashed Jhin to terrorize and get control of Ionia . Jhin knows the truth about the circumstance of Kusho's \"death\" and could have revealed to Shen if he had wanted to but didn't as he realized Zed was going after Kusho.\nJhin has some resentment towards Shen and Zed for catching him and imprisoning him. During each of his encounters with both Shen and Zed, he would leave a trail of gruesome deaths behind him, which would forever change the two ninjas. After he was released, Jhin would force Zed and Shen to work together so he might kill them both for catching him years before. He attacked Zed, Kayn and their order , killing some of the members.\nJhin has some interest in killing Sona for being a very famous Ionian artist who is taking the spotlight away from his 'performances'."}

But after a falling-out with his former partner, K'Sante realizes that in order to become a warrior worthy of leading his city, he must temper his single-minded drive for success. Only then can he avoid falling prey to his own pride and find the wisdom he needs to defeat the vicious monsters threatening his people.\nK'Sante was born in the Shuriman city of Nazumah , a city-state independent from the rule of the Shuriman emperor Azir and home to a culture based around hunting ferocious monsters that roamed the oasis. Inspired by his parents' teachings and stories of Nazumah's history, K'Sante dreamt of becoming his homeland's greatest warrior-hunter. For twenty years, K'Sante trained under the tutelage of several teachers, learning how to extract materials from beasts and craft them into weaponry and infrastructure. During his first years of hunting, K'Sante formed a close friendship with a fellow hunter named Tope , who fought alongside him as they hunted 5 rockbear herds, shakkal raiders and even some Xer'Sai . The two formed a close bond over the years and K'Sante eventually confessed his love for Tope, who in turn revealed that the feelings were mutual as the two shared their first kiss.\nWith the resurrection of Azir , Xerath waged a violent crusade to take over Shurima and eradicate Azir's bloodline. The two Ascended waged battles against one another with monstrous forces and Nazumah was caught in the crossfire. Xerath, experimenting with a Sun Disc of his own, attempted to use its powers of Ascension to empower and fuse Shuriman fauna together, producing Baccai monsters. One such creature, a hybrid between a cobra and a lion, began terrorizing a nearby savannah and alerted K'Sante and Tope, who both vowed to hunt down and kill the cobra-lion. Unfortunately, they were unable to wound the creature due to its rapidly regenerating hide, forcing them to flee emptyhanded. The two trained to slay the cobra-lion and made various other attempts to kill the beast to no avail. Tope spent his time formulating strategies and studying how to weaken the beast's regenerative properties, making some progress by chipping away a portion of its hide. K'Sante was unsatisfied by the development however, getting lost in his prideful pursuit for glory in killing the creature. His pride got so problematic that that he began to look down on Tope, accusing him of holding him back from a successful hunt. The two argued over their differing methods of how to defeat the cobra-lion until they had a falling out, separating as lovers and going their separate ways.\nK'Sante spent the next year training and trying to defeat the cobra-lion by himself but would keep failing, causing him to come to terms with his inability to slay the beast by himself. With that, he gained the courage to seek Tope's help and travelled to his home only to find Tope's aunt instead. His aunt greeted K'Sante and revealed that her nephew had left Nazumah and returned to his hometown in Marrowmark shortly after their separation. However, she handed K'Sante one of Tope's journals, stating that he left it behind to assist him on finally slaying the cobra-lion one day. K'Sante thoroughly studied Tope's journal and read his theories on the beast's true nature as a Baccai, theorizing that the magical properties of Nazumah's natural waters could weaken the beast's regenerating armor. K'Sante remembered his parents' teachings, realizing he had grown too prideful of himself and failed to respect Tope's ideas. Accepting his mistakes and finding a newfound respect for his former lover, K'Sante set off to slay the cobra-lion once and for all.\nBeneath a scarlet sky, K'Sante had a final battle against the beast, taking a more calculated approach and dodging its attacks while striking when its guard was lowered. As his body was bloodied and his weapons were shattered, the beast finally tired and K'Sante saw an opportunity to strike the final blow. Inspired by Tope's theories, he lured the cobra-lion into a Nazuman waterfall, weakening its armor in the natural waters and finally slaying the beast. [ 1 ]\nHis victory was celebrated and and he donated the Baccai's body to be studied under Nazuman tradition. The only parts of the beast that he kept were two slabs of its hide, crafting them into his signature ntofos and specially engineered to utilize the beast's regenerative properties. In his ntofos, K'Sante also carved a lion's head, the symbol Tope used to represent the beast in his journal, as a way to honor his partner's hand in slaying the beast even after their relationship ended.\nAfter his victorious hunt of the cobra-lion, K'Sante was hailed as the Pride of Nazumah, and the city-state was so grateful that they planned a major celebration to place his name within their esteemed Hunter's Hall, where the greatest hunters of Nazumah were honored for their great deeds and victorious hunts.\nAs the Pride of Nazumah, K'Sante acts as the guardian of his city, defending it from other monstrous beasts, raiders and even the battling forces of the Ascended such as Azir and Xerath's followers.\nOutside of Nazumah, K'Sante battled against a group of mad zealots following Xerath. K'Sante fought them off despite his severe injuries, slowly being overwhelmed by the amount of zealots. Unexpectedly, he was saved by a mysterious, masked warrior armed with a bow and leading a group of archers, all of them wearing a striking green and gold outfit. K'Sante fought alongside these archers and they effortlessly defeated the raiders, to which the masked warrior revealed himself as Tope, K'Sante's former lover. Impressed by K'Sante's combat and entertained by their reunion together, Tope invited K'Sante to his hunting group's camp nearby, offering to heal his injuries. K'Sante initially refused, but quickly succumbed to his intense injuries and collapsed on the ground, falling unconscious.\nTwo days later, K'Sante woke up in the camp, greeted by Tope waiting near his bed. Tope explains how, over the past few months, the Ascended have been sending their armies farther down south, encroaching on territories such as Marrowmark and Nazumah. The two bonded over a meal and talked about their current lives, reminiscing on their past relationship and how far they've come since then. Tope reveals that he is now a commander for his own Marrowmarkman hunting party, while K'Sante invites Tope to attend the celebration of his name being placed in Nazumah's Hunter's Hall. Tope, grateful for the invite, refuses due to the fact that he is getting married around the same time. K'Sante, surprised and slightly flustered, feels genuine happiness for Tope and congratulates him on his marriage.\nAs the two talk more about their past, Tope recalled their falling out years ago and apologized for not supporting K'Sante enough during the hunt for the cobra-lion. K'Sante quickly interjected and objected to Tope's apology, stating that he has to apologize for how badly his pride took over and how he hurt Tope by disregarding his strategies. After that, the two make a toast, wishing each other the best of luck on their paths and feeling a deeper sense of friendship and love for one another. [ 2 ]\nK'Sante is extremely tall and muscular, with massively broad shoulders. He has dark skin, black hair, and orange-brown eyes. He wears his hair in short, messy locs with the sides shaved. He also has a medium-length beard and a short mustache.\nHe has a colorful sense of fashion, his signature outfit consisting of numerous layers and varying bright colors. He wears a red jacket with a gold trim and a gold, red, and purple pattern of rhombuses on the sleeves. Underneath is a long tunic, brown at the chest and light violet below. Around his neck is a deep blue scarf with purple stripes in some areas. His hands feature blue-gray fingerless loves with gold bracers. On his legs, he wears blue-gray pants with golden kneepads and short brown boots. He also wears golden, circular plates of varying sizes tied to gold-colored ropes draped across his torso.\nHis ntofos are enormous, plank-shaped blunt weapons with handles on the edge near the lower end. Metallic turquoise, they are intricately carved with a symbol of a roaring lion at the top end and a golden circle at the bottom. The handles have a brown leather grip. When they shatter into blades, they appear far smoother and feature a series of curved stripes in yellow, purple, and dark turquoise.\nK'Sante is a determined and ambitious individual who grew up with a deep reverence for his homeland and a desire to become its greatest warrior-hunter thanks to the many stories he heard as a child. He is fiercely independent and believes that he must prove himself through his own strength and achievements, but often refuses to accept help or support from others. This intense drive and pride in his own abilities lead him to dismiss the ideas and strategies of his partner, Tope, ultimately straining their relationship.\nNow, K'Sante remains incredibly ambitious and passionate about his own nation. He speaks with lots of confidence and fearlessness especially on a hunt. Though he still sometimes struggles with humbling himself for the sake of others, he is actively aware of not letting his own hubris take over.\nAs it is in Nazuman culture, K'Sante does not follow any of the Ascended and has a strong opposition towards them. He hates the idea of the Ascended self-proclaiming to be gods above mortals and sees their ongoing conflict with each other as a threat against his homeland.\nTope and K'Sante trained and hunted together for years, becoming an extremely talented and inseparable duo of hunters. Eventually, the two confessed their love for one another and, after sharing their first kiss, grew into an official, romantic relationship. While hunting for the cobra-lion, K'Sante became more prideful of himself and often argued with Tope over their differing methods in hunting down the Baccai beast, eventually having a massive falling out and separating as lovers. K'Sante, having to hunt the beast alone, swallowed his pride and sought Tope's help once more, only to find out that he had moved back to Marrowmark. However, he had left behind his journal and his many studies on the beast, revealing to K'Sante his many plans and strategies to kill the cobra-lion, which ultimately proved effective in the end once he slew it.\nThe two reunited years later when battling some zealous followers of the Ascended Xerath , fighting alongside each other as Tope nursed K'Sante back to health at his nearby camp over two days. Once awake, the two shared a meal together and reminisced on each other's lives, with K'Sante revealing a massive celebration being held for him and Tope having his wedding to a new lover that same time. Tope tried to apologize for leaving K'Sante during the hunt for the cobra-lion, but K'Sante interjected and stated that he should be apologizing instead for how he let his pride get the best of him and how he mistreated Tope in their relationship. Despite their past, the two hold a deep friendship and appreciation for one another, as K'Sante is genuinely happy that Tope found true love in his future husband and Tope is happy for K'Sante's new honorary title as the Pride of Nazumah. [ 2 ]\nHistorically, Nazumah is independent from the rule of the Shuriman emperor and denies any Ascended, seeing them as a threat. That said, K'Sante holds disdain for any of the Ascended, seeing them as one of the main threats he seeks to protect Nazumah from. With the growing conflict between Azir and Xerath , Nazumah is caught in the crossfire and K'Sante, as the Pride of Nazumah, fights against them and their followers.\nNazumah rejects the rule of Azir as emperor and functions as a completely independent city-state. K'Sante has a disdain for Azir and his conquests over Shurima, seeing his rule as a threat to Nazuman culture. Though Xerath is responsible for atrocities against his people, such as the rampaging cobra-lion, he places blame on Azir as well for being the one that Xerath is fighting against.\nThe infamous cobra-lion that K'Sante and his lover Tope hunted years ago was actually the product of failed experiments by Xerath, as he attempted to fuse Shuriman fauna together with Ascension magic using a makeshift Sun Disc of his own. Because of that, K'Sante holds an even deeper hatred for Xerath, seeing him as a massive threat against his people due to the atrocities he's already committed.\nK'Sante has battled many of Xerath's zealous followers already, most recently reuniting with his lover Tope to fight off a large band of them seeking to kill K'Sante and invade Nazumah.

But after a falling-out with his former partner, K'Sante realizes that in order to become a warrior worthy of leading his city, he must temper his single-minded drive for success. Only then can he avoid falling prey to his own pride and find the wisdom he needs to defeat the vicious monsters threatening his people.\nK'Sante was born in the Shuriman city of Nazumah , a city-state independent from the rule of the Shuriman emperor Azir and home to a culture based around hunting ferocious monsters that roamed the oasis. Inspired by his parents' teachings and stories of Nazumah's history, K'Sante dreamt of becoming his homeland's greatest warrior-hunter. For twenty years, K'Sante trained under the tutelage of several teachers, learning how to extract materials from beasts and craft them into weaponry and infrastructure. During his first years of hunting, K'Sante formed a close friendship with a fellow hunter named Tope , who fought alongside him as they hunted 5 rockbear herds, shakkal raiders and even some Xer'Sai . The two formed a close bond over the years and K'Sante eventually confessed his love for Tope, who in turn revealed that the feelings were mutual as the two shared their first kiss.\nWith the resurrection of Azir , Xerath waged a violent crusade to take over Shurima and eradicate Azir's bloodline. The two Ascended waged battles against one another with monstrous forces and Nazumah was caught in the crossfire. Xerath, experimenting with a Sun Disc of his own, attempted to use its powers of Ascension to empower and fuse Shuriman fauna together, producing Baccai monsters. One such creature, a hybrid between a cobra and a lion, began terrorizing a nearby savannah and alerted K'Sante and Tope, who both vowed to hunt down and kill the cobra-lion. Unfortunately, they were unable to wound the creature due to its rapidly regenerating hide, forcing them to flee emptyhanded. The two trained to slay the cobra-lion and made various other attempts to kill the beast to no avail. Tope spent his time formulating strategies and studying how to weaken the beast's regenerative properties, making some progress by chipping away a portion of its hide. K'Sante was unsatisfied by the development however, getting lost in his prideful pursuit for glory in killing the creature. His pride got so problematic that that he began to look down on Tope, accusing him of holding him back from a successful hunt. The two argued over their differing methods of how to defeat the cobra-lion until they had a falling out, separating as lovers and going their separate ways.\nK'Sante spent the next year training and trying to defeat the cobra-lion by himself but would keep failing, causing him to come to terms with his inability to slay the beast by himself. With that, he gained the courage to seek Tope's help and travelled to his home only to find Tope's aunt instead. His aunt greeted K'Sante and revealed that her nephew had left Nazumah and returned to his hometown in Marrowmark shortly after their separation. However, she handed K'Sante one of Tope's journals, stating that he left it behind to assist him on finally slaying the cobra-lion one day. K'Sante thoroughly studied Tope's journal and read his theories on the beast's true nature as a Baccai, theorizing that the magical properties of Nazumah's natural waters could weaken the beast's regenerating armor. K'Sante remembered his parents' teachings, realizing he had grown too prideful of himself and failed to respect Tope's ideas. Accepting his mistakes and finding a newfound respect for his former lover, K'Sante set off to slay the cobra-lion once and for all.\nBeneath a scarlet sky, K'Sante had a final battle against the beast, taking a more calculated approach and dodging its attacks while striking when its guard was lowered. As his body was bloodied and his weapons were shattered, the beast finally tired and K'Sante saw an opportunity to strike the final blow. Inspired by Tope's theories, he lured the cobra-lion into a Nazuman waterfall, weakening its armor in the natural waters and finally slaying the beast. [ 1 ]\nHis victory was celebrated and and he donated the Baccai's body to be studied under Nazuman tradition. The only parts of the beast that he kept were two slabs of its hide, crafting them into his signature ntofos and specially engineered to utilize the beast's regenerative properties. In his ntofos, K'Sante also carved a lion's head, the symbol Tope used to represent the beast in his journal, as a way to honor his partner's hand in slaying the beast even after their relationship ended.\nAfter his victorious hunt of the cobra-lion, K'Sante was hailed as the Pride of Nazumah, and the city-state was so grateful that they planned a major celebration to place his name within their esteemed Hunter's Hall, where the greatest hunters of Nazumah were honored for their great deeds and victorious hunts.\nAs the Pride of Nazumah, K'Sante acts as the guardian of his city, defending it from other monstrous beasts, raiders and even the battling forces of the Ascended such as Azir and Xerath's followers.\nOutside of Nazumah, K'Sante battled against a group of mad zealots following Xerath. K'Sante fought them off despite his severe injuries, slowly being overwhelmed by the amount of zealots. Unexpectedly, he was saved by a mysterious, masked warrior armed with a bow and leading a group of archers, all of them wearing a striking green and gold outfit. K'Sante fought alongside these archers and they effortlessly defeated the raiders, to which the masked warrior revealed himself as Tope, K'Sante's former lover. Impressed by K'Sante's combat and entertained by their reunion together, Tope invited K'Sante to his hunting group's camp nearby, offering to heal his injuries. K'Sante initially refused, but quickly succumbed to his intense injuries and collapsed on the ground, falling unconscious.\nTwo days later, K'Sante woke up in the camp, greeted by Tope waiting near his bed. Tope explains how, over the past few months, the Ascended have been sending their armies farther down south, encroaching on territories such as Marrowmark and Nazumah. The two bonded over a meal and talked about their current lives, reminiscing on their past relationship and how far they've come since then. Tope reveals that he is now a commander for his own Marrowmarkman hunting party, while K'Sante invites Tope to attend the celebration of his name being placed in Nazumah's Hunter's Hall. Tope, grateful for the invite, refuses due to the fact that he is getting married around the same time.

Having entered into an uneasy symbiosis with a living Void carapace, the time will soon come when she must decide whether to forgive those mortals who would call her a monster, and defeat the coming darkness together... or simply to forget, as the Void consumes the world that left her behind.\nKaisa was an ordinary girl born in the southern deserts of Shurima. During her tenth summer, she came upon a pen of sacrificial goats. The girl tried to release the animals but then, suddenly, the ground shook, flashes of light scorched the sky, and a rift opened up the earth. The rift swallowed up the entire village and everyone inside.\nNow trapped under the desert, Kaisa could hear the faint voices of others trapped inside. But soon, hers was the only voice left. The first void creature she encountered was about her size. After being knocked down by the voidling, Kaisa drove her knife into its heart, killing it.\nAlthough the creature was dead, its flesh clung to Kaisa’s arm. She was unable to remove it and soon enough, it started growing around her as though it was becoming part of her. She was able to use the second skin as armor against other void creatures. The longer she survived against the void, the greater her confidence grew until she finally managed to escape back to the desert surface. No longer was she the little girl who fell into the rift but was now a fearless hunter of the void.\nAfter many years below the surface, Kai'Sa rememerged to the surface. A young girl named Illi discovered Kai'Sa beside a pit. Kai'Sa guided Illi on how to confront the impending Void threat. Illi, brave and determined, stood by Kai'Sa's side as they faced Void creatures. Kai'Sa imparted the wisdom she gained from fighting the Voidborn over the years to Illi. She advised her to starve the Void and explained the necessity of running at times. When Illi's village searched for her, Kai'Sa encouraged Illi to go to her father and prepared her for the challenges ahead.\nIn the depths of the earth, Kai'Sa navigated the Void-infested underworld. She found a leader of a nearby settlement up on the surface and captured him in order to show him the imminent threat below. As they journeyed through treacherous tunnels, Kai'Sa reflected on her altered perception, her symbiotic relationship with the living armor, and the sacrifices she made to survive in the darkness.\nAs they emerged closer to the surface than expected, Kai'Sa realized the urgency of the impending Void threat. The leader, initially blind to the darkness, witnessed the horrors of the abyss. Thousands of monstrous creatures emerged, their malevolent intent clear. Kai'Sa confronted the leader, urging him to understand the danger and protect his people. The leader, still blind to the imminent threat his people faced, pleaded to be released. Kai'Sa contemplated the morality of her actions, torn between saving lives and succumbing to her predatory instincts. The living armor hungered for the leader's essence, but she resisted, determined to safeguard the surface.\nFighting through the creatures, Kai'Sa brought the leader back to the surface, only to discover a settlement unaware of the imminent danger. Setting a warning marker, she realized her past actions inadvertently attracted the Voidborn . Panic ensued as she unleashed destructive energy to force the settlement's evacuation. As night fell, Kai'Sa stood on a rock spire, witnessing the approaching Void horde. The settlement evacuated, harboring fear and hatred for the once-human girl. Kai'Sa embraced her role as their protector, ready to face the monsters and become the necessary monster to ensure the survival of those she now considered her people.\nKai'Sa meets Taliyah\nIn the desolate void-ridden landscape, Kai'Sa, navigated a purposeful Void tunnel that defied the chaotic nature of the Void. As she confronted the newly discovered Voidborn she dubbed \"Lamplights\", she battled relentlessly, only to find herself overwhelmed. In a twist of fate, Taliyah rescued Kai'Sa from the clutches of the Lamplights. Together, they returned to a community of survivors in Taliyah's camp, where initial fear and skepticism towards Kai'Sa gradually transformed into trust and acceptance through shared meals and vulnerable moments.\nAmidst the flickering firelight and the scent of roasting meat, Kai'Sa contended not only with her physical injuries but also the weight of the survivors' gaze, haunted by the fear of the unknown. Kai'Sa began to understand the power of alliances and the shared struggle against the pervasive darkness, as she decided to stay and heal.\nAs the group shared tales of their losses and hopes, Kai'Sa remained skeptical of a mythical sanctuary called Xolan , proposed by a fellow survivor. Tensions rose when Taliyah expressed determination to lead the group to Xolan, across the Sai Kahleek . Kai'Sa warned of the perils, revealing her firsthand knowledge of the deadly Xer'Sai that infested the area. Despite her objections, Taliyah, fueled by hope and a plan to build stone bridges for safe passage, remained resolute in her quest.\nAs the survivors crosses the Sai Kahleek desert, they encountered a nest of Xer'Sai . Kai'Sa tookmatters into her own hands to protect the group, but the situation escalated as a colossal Xer'Sai -- 6 Xer'sai Dunebreaker -- emerges, threatening the survivors. After barely defeating the Voidborn and saving the survivors, they contemplated a new destination. Taliyah agreed with Kai'Sa that there was no safe haven, so she decided to make one. Kai'Sa and Taliyah set out to Xolan alone in order to defeat the Xer'Sai that lived their and make Xolan a safe haven for all the Southern people of Shurima .\nTaliyah and Kai'Sa arrived in Xolan to find the town abandoned and destroyed. They were then attacked by a group of Xer'Sai , but fended them off before a sinkhole appeared in the ground. Rek'Sai emerged from the pit, and Kai'Sa lured her back underground. This allowed Taliyah to bring the statue of Xolaani , the 'faceless god', over the sinkhole to prevent Rek'Sai from re-emerging.\nBel'Veth confronts Kai'Sa with the truth\nAfter plunging back into the Void -invested grounds of southern Shurima , Kai'Sa found herself ensnared in the depths of the Lavender Sea . Navigating through the unnatural environment, she eventually came face to face with its monstrous empress, Bel'Veth . Overwhelmed by the empress's formidable strength, Kai'Sa succumbed swiftly, defeated and confined to one of the many grotesque walls that adorned the fake sea.\nWithin the ominous presence of Bel'Veth, Kai'Sa's reality shattered anew as the empress unveiled the haunting truth about her father, Kassadin . Though still alive, the Void had shattered Kassadin's mind, leaving him lost in the ancient abyss. As Kai'Sa grappled with the shock of her father's existence, Bel'Veth delved into the history of the Void, explaining the symbiotic corruption between the Void and reality, where both realms influenced and tainted each other.\nBel'Veth presented Kai'Sa with an ultimatum. The survival of the world hinged on an uneasy alliance – Kai'Sa must assist the empress in eradicating her progenitors, the Watchers . In return, Bel'Veth offered Kai'Sa time to devise a plan to defeat her, confident in the belief that the girl stood no chance against her might. Ordering Kai'Sa to \"find the Watchers and confirm the truth,\" Bel'Veth released her captive, prompting Kai'Sa to instinctively rocket towards the surface, escaping the Lavender Sea .\nKai'Sa is a slender, pale-skinned woman with long dark brown hair and violet eyes. Her robes are composed of a Void Symbiote with a distinct palette of grey, dark grey, purple and bronze. The most distinctive ornaments of her attire are some purple marks on her face.\nSpending many years alone in the Void-infested Shuriman catacombs away from humanity has made Kai'sa very stoic, calculative and not very communicative. Despite her horrible circumstances, she still longs to be with other people and is still capable of connecting with others like Taliyah and Ezreal . She has shown to have a strong sense of duty towards the other desert-dwelling people of Shurima as she acts as their silent protector against Void predators despite the possible disdain she might receive from revealing herself.\nKaisa unwittingly released the sacrificial goats meant for Malzahar 's cultists into a Void-linked canyon as a prank to a transiting desert nomad, causing an earthquake that devastated her village, swallowing and killing all inhabitants except herself, who survived thanks to the symbiote suit and learning the Voidborns' methods of predation\nKassadin lived in the same village as Kai'sa before the village was engulfed by The Void. The event killed Kassadin's wife and child, causing Kassadin to go on his quest for revenge against The Void. While is has not been confirmed, a prevailing theory among players is that Kai'sa is Kassadin's daughter. While their relationship in the main universe has not been formally confirmed, it has been implied through voice lines and in the Four Beasts , Riot Records , and Star Guardian universes, Kassadin is K/DA Kai'Sa's father. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Bel'Veth reveals that Kai'Sa's father was the only other person to survive the Void, the only person being Kassadin .\nKai'Sa saved Ezreal when he was attacked by Void creatures. Ezreal later helped her fight them.\nKai'Sa encountered Taliyah and her group on their journey to find Xolan , a mythical paradise in Sai Kahleek . They fought some void creatures together, including some of Rek'Sai's Xer'Sai . Taliyah would then part way with the others and join Kai'Sa in going there.\nBel'Veth is an enemy of Kai'Sa, Naturally feeling animosity towards the empress, Kai'Sa was shocked when Bel'Veth revealed she and her motives were more than a simple Voidborn's , talking about how she would be her salvation and even making a pragmatic deal to spare humanity so she would defeat the Watchers ."}

Kalista saw Isolde as a sister and enjoyed the positive influence she had on his uncle.\nWhen Viego was targeted by an assassin sent to kill him with a poisoned blade, Kalista deflected the blade in time but accidentally caused it to graze Isolde instead. With the best medics and priests in Camavor unable to save her, a grief-stricken Viego sent Kalista, along with the captain of the Iron Order, Hecarim , to find a cure. While most nations were unable to give her the results she wanted, she learned of the Blessed Isles and was able to get the Waters of Life that could cure even the direst of ailments. But when she got back, Isolde had already succumbed to the poison. Viego, maddened by grief, saw Kalista as a traitor to the crown and got her imprisoned.\nIn the dungeons, Kalista was visited by Hecarim, who manipulated her into revealing the location of the Blessed Isles all so he could reap glory for himself. Hecarim then told Viego about the information she gave him, which led to the fleets of Camavor sailing to the capital of the Blessed Isles, Helia .\nHowever, the elders of the Blessed Isles refused to let the Camavorans pass, as they believed that death was final and to cheat it would break the natural order of the world. Viego ignored their warnings and ordered Kalista to kill them. She refused and tried to get Hecarim to stand with her, but he and his knights killed her by driving their spears into her back, before killing her lover Ledros and all the Camavoran soldiers loyal to her. Then, they began to raid the Blessed Isles, looting their treasures and killing all of the natives they could find. But thanks to Viego's failed attempt to revive his wife, the Blessed Isles' protective barrier was tainted by the magic of Viego's blade , causing a disaster which turned it into the ghostly realm now known as the Shadow Isles .\nMany of the people within the Isles at the time of the Ruination, both living and dead, were reborn as ghostly wraiths . Kalista was one such wraith, who remembered nothing but her feelings of vengeance toward Hecarim as she died. She became a spirit of vengeance, travelling all over Runeterra to appear before those who made pacts in her name, absorbing their souls to kill the ones whom had betrayed them. But with each soul she absorbed, her humanity disappeared as she became a hive mind of vengeful souls who avenged the wronged across Runeterra.\nIn life, Kalista was a woman with an athletic physique, brown skin, brown eyes, and long, flowing black hair. Her regal Camavoran armor was blue plate with a gold trim. She wore a cloth around the back of her legs and an open-faced helmet with a long, dark plume. She wielded a spear.\nIn death, Kalista is a translucent, teal spirit. She appears emaciated and hunched, with several spectral spears protruding from her torso. While her armor remains opaque, it is now black and dark brown with tattered cloth portions. Her spears, which now materialize in her hands, are jagged and spectral.\nWhile being of royal blood, Kalista was surprisingly down to earth in life and had a strong sense of justice. She got along far better with the common footsoldiers in the military than the nobles trying to curry favour with her. She was also depicted as caring sister figure to a young Viego when he suddenly was to be crowned as king of Camavor and tried to be his emotional and moral support during his reign, with some help from Isolde .\nWhen she became a wraith, Kalista lost much of her humanity. With only the memories of betrayals she has suffered in her life, an intense thirst for revenge persisted, becoming a vengeful spirit.\nKalista is the Ruined King's niece and was one of his generals in life. Kalista's father was the previous king of Camavor . Viego became the king after his brother died in battle. Despite being her uncle, Kalista and Viego were around the same age and friends for a long time since he was largely ignored in favor of Kalista's father. When her father died and Viego became king, his negative traits were worsened and they began to drift apart, however she was still loyal to him. Kalista managed to protect Viego from an assassin, but resulted in Isolde getting poisoned instead. She would set sail in order to find a cure, but found it too late and was imprisoned as a traitor for her failure.She was eventually convinced by Hecarim to lead Viego and their army to the Blessed Isles for the Waters of Life. When the masters of the island refused to let them use the water, Viego ordered her to kill anyone who opposed them. Kalista refused and was stabbed by Hecarim before her forces clashed with the Iron Order.\nCommander Ledros was her lover in life and is trying to free her soul. Thresh tried to persuade him to give up trying to free Kalista and so far has succeeded at obtaining his silver pendant which Ledros may use to remind Kalista of her humanity, but Ledros instead has tried to end the curse of the Ruination himself.\nHecarim and his Iron Order are now restlessly hunted and \"killed\" by her, but they always come back due to the Black Mist.\nVladimir was soul-marked by Kalista but he was able to banish her with the help of a magical artifact. He was a prince of Camavor, and Viego and Kalista's distant relative who was centuries old by the time they were born.\nKalista occasionally comes after Tahm Kench ; however, he is safe from her due to his contracts with the victims.\nIn her journey to the Blessed Isles, Kalista crossed paths with Ryze during his formative years. Initially, she found the young apprentice brimming with arrogance and entitlement, reminiscent of her uncle, Viego . Their first encounter ended with Ryze's arm twisted, after which Ryze started to be far more respectful towards the Camavoran princess.\nWhen hearing had Kalista sacrificed herself in order to give the people of Helia a chance to escape from the invading Camavorans, Ryze regretted not having had the opportunity to apologize for their initial meeting."}

She is the living embodiment of an ancient soul reincarnated countless times, carrying all her accumulated memories into each new life, and blessed with power that few can comprehend. She has done her best to guide her people in recent times of crisis, though she knows that peace and harmony may come only at a considerable cost—both to her, and to the land she holds most dear.\nKarma is an ancient spirit of Ionia which has guided the Ionian people for many generations, taking the form of many human incarnations throughout history. One known incarnation, Jakgri, had to leave his lover Watai in order to take on his duties as Karma. After his death, the collective spirit of Karma moved on to its current host: Darha, a girl who was raised in Shon-Xan and carried Kathkani ancestry. At the age of twelve, she began to see visions of memories that weren't hers, and she tried to resist the visions at first before she could no longer handle them. Sent to rest at a healing hut, Darha recognized a group of monks from the Lasting Altar who visited her village to search for the next reincarnation of Karma. Just as they prepared to leave unsuccessful, Darha ran to them, crying to them about her visions and recognizing their voices from her visions. The monks realized that Darha's visions were the result of Karma's past lives moving on to their next vessel, so they adopted her as the new Karma. Leaving her old life behind, Darha was taught how to connect and communicate with the past lives of Karma, and adopted the traditional philosophy of promoting peace and harmony while leaving acts of evil to await their own consequences. But in spite of these teachings, Darha felt confliction of these philosophies, to the confusion of her followers.\nWhen the forces of Noxus invaded Ionia, Karma felt the true horrors of war as millions of Ionians were slaughtered by the Noxians. The voices within Karma told her to remain at the Lasting Altar and handle the conflict peacefully, but an even bigger urge to take action swelled in her. Feeling agonized by her internal conflict, Karma stood up and headed out to act. She confronted a Noxian commander on his war frigate by blasting him with divine energy, destroying the ship and killing many of the crew members.\nThe Ionian civilians cheered for Karma's victory, but the monks believed that she had misused her power and went against everything the spirit of Karma stood for, bringing dishonor to her past lives. Karma interrupted with a raised hand, with the spirit of Ionia intervening to defend itself when necessary. She realized that the true way to keep harmony was to accept that the world was changing rather than ignoring it. As the Ionians ended up stirring into conflict as a result of the war, Karma dedicated herself to guiding her people to peace, while condoning action to be taken when necessary.\nMany years after the death of Jakgri, his lover Watai visited the Lasting Altar to receive Karma's healing after being damaged by a fall. Karma healed her leg, but Watai felt contempt towards her due to her pain towards Jakgri's death. Karma admitted to her guilt towards her involvement in the Noxian conflct and being unable to apologize to the people whose lives were ruined by the war, but had no regrets for acting upon Ionia's will to fight back. Watai showed Karma her ring which Jakgri had given her, where the two had to be separated due to having to live their lives far away from each other. Suddenly, Karma's eyes glowed the same color that Jakgri's had when he was Karma. Watai began to tear up, emotional towards the possibility of Jakgri's soul still being in there. Karma told her that he was now a part of the avatar's shared mind, and Watai started to resign to the thought that he had a new life to live. Suddenly, Karma was taken over by the collective spirits, whom reassured Watai that Jakgri loved her until the end and he wanted her to keep her ring. Watai thanked Karma for allowing him to come back, but Karma thanked her since Jakgri's voice had become silent for a long time after the war, but it was she who brought him back. Karma invited Watai to stay at the Lasting Alter for a few more days so they could both heal. By the end of the period, Jakgri's spirit became a part of Karma again, and Watai left knowing that not even death could stop the two's love for each other.\nWhen the Ruined King returned to the world of Runeterra, he resumed his search for his fallen queen. He would unleash harrowings across Runeterra in search of the fragments of her soul. Karma would defend the Lasting Altar against one of these Harrowings, but was nearly overwhelmed and corrupted by the king. The Harrowing would subside, when Viego obtained a soul fragment from Senna , but Karma would be left influenced by the king's magic. Karma would eventually come into possession of one of the fetters of Queen Isolde's soul, a silver flower.\nThe King would soon continue his search, with aid from his Yordle companion, Vex , by unleashing a global Harrowing, spreading Black Mist across Runeterra. The Sentinels of Light would arrive in Ionia in search of the fragment and were guided to the Lasting Altar by Irelia . Karma proposed hiding the fetter within an ancient Vastayan groves, guarded by ancient magics that not even the Black Mist could penetrate. As they prepared to leave, they would be ambushed by an army of Mistwalkers, the Sentinels and Irelia would hold off the ghouls while Karma fled towards the grove.\nThe Sentinels would catch up to Karma and they escorted her towards the grove, she began to express regret at not having done more during the Noxian invasion. Karma's regret caused her become susceptible to the influence of the Black Magic and she began to become ruined. Now under the sway of the Ruined King, she would attempt to flee with the fetter, but the Sentinels intercepted her. They manage to incapacite and momentarily purify her, she then reveals the King's plan, to use the fragments of the queen's soul to resurrect her. They are soon spotted by another hoard of ghouls, Karma gives the Sentinels the fetter and tells them to leave her as she succumbs to the Black Mist again. Karma would then become fully corrupted by the Black Mist and become an agent of Viego.\nShe and Draven would accompany the Ruined King to Shurima to search for another fetter. She, alongside the other corrupted champions, would face off against the Sentinels of Light when they mounted their final assault against the Shadow Isles. Viego would resurrect Isolde, but would be to rest again by Akshan and his Absolver. The Sentinels imprisoned Viego within Hallow Mist in Camavor. With Viego defeated, his corruption would subside and Karma and others would be free from the Ruined King's influence.\nKarma is a tall, slim and curvaceous young woman with slightly brown skin, short brown hair and emerald green eyes, she wears makeup with marks under her eyes, dark red lipstick, dark eye shadow and wears a kind of golden headband with a gem. aquamarine green in the center.\nHer clothes consist of a long Ionian dress with different shades of purple and violet colors, with golden lines that run through the entire dress, it has a white sash that is tightened with a purple bow, its right side has a long sleeve and the leg is exposed and her left side has an exposed arm and a purple sock on her left leg.\nKarma is depicted as a wise and compassionate individual with a strong sense of responsibility and duty. As an ancient spirit of Ionia, she has guided the Ionian people for generations, taking on various human incarnations throughout history. Karma is known for her wisdom and guidance. She carries the collective memories and experiences of her past lives, which allows her to offer valuable insights and advice to those around her. Her guidance is often sought in times of uncertainty or conflict. Despite her commitment to peace, Karma experiences an internal conflict when faced with the brutality of war. Her struggle to balance her desire for harmony with the need for action and protection. She grapples with the ethical dilemma of whether to remain pacifist in the face of conflict or take more direct action to protect her people."}

After his death, the collective spirit of Karma moved on to its current host: Darha, a girl who was raised in Shon-Xan and carried Kathkani ancestry. At the age of twelve, she began to see visions of memories that weren't hers, and she tried to resist the visions at first before she could no longer handle them. Sent to rest at a healing hut, Darha recognized a group of monks from the Lasting Altar who visited her village to search for the next reincarnation of Karma. Just as they prepared to leave unsuccessful, Darha ran to them, crying to them about her visions and recognizing their voices from her visions. The monks realized that Darha's visions were the result of Karma's past lives moving on to their next vessel, so they adopted her as the new Karma. Leaving her old life behind, Darha was taught how to connect and communicate with the past lives of Karma, and adopted the traditional philosophy of promoting peace and harmony while leaving acts of evil to await their own consequences. But in spite of these teachings, Darha felt confliction of these philosophies, to the confusion of her followers.\nWhen the forces of Noxus invaded Ionia, Karma felt the true horrors of war as millions of Ionians were slaughtered by the Noxians. The voices within Karma told her to remain at the Lasting Altar and handle the conflict peacefully, but an even bigger urge to take action swelled in her. Feeling agonized by her internal conflict, Karma stood up and headed out to act. She confronted a Noxian commander on his war frigate by blasting him with divine energy, destroying the ship and killing many of the crew members.\nThe Ionian civilians cheered for Karma's victory, but the monks believed that she had misused her power and went against everything the spirit of Karma stood for, bringing dishonor to her past lives. Karma interrupted with a raised hand, with the spirit of Ionia intervening to defend itself when necessary. She realized that the true way to keep harmony was to accept that the world was changing rather than ignoring it. As the Ionians ended up stirring into conflict as a result of the war, Karma dedicated herself to guiding her people to peace, while condoning action to be taken when necessary.\nMany years after the death of Jakgri, his lover Watai visited the Lasting Altar to receive Karma's healing after being damaged by a fall. Karma healed her leg, but Watai felt contempt towards her due to her pain towards Jakgri's death. Karma admitted to her guilt towards her involvement in the Noxian conflct and being unable to apologize to the people whose lives were ruined by the war, but had no regrets for acting upon Ionia's will to fight back. Watai showed Karma her ring which Jakgri had given her, where the two had to be separated due to having to live their lives far away from each other. Suddenly, Karma's eyes glowed the same color that Jakgri's had when he was Karma. Watai began to tear up, emotional towards the possibility of Jakgri's soul still being in there. Karma told her that he was now a part of the avatar's shared mind, and Watai started to resign to the thought that he had a new life to live. Suddenly, Karma was taken over by the collective spirits, whom reassured Watai that Jakgri loved her until the end and he wanted her to keep her ring. Watai thanked Karma for allowing him to come back, but Karma thanked her since Jakgri's voice had become silent for a long time after the war, but it was she who brought him back. Karma invited Watai to stay at the Lasting Alter for a few more days so they could both heal. By the end of the period, Jakgri's spirit became a part of Karma again, and Watai left knowing that not even death could stop the two's love for each other.\nWhen the Ruined King returned to the world of Runeterra, he resumed his search for his fallen queen. He would unleash harrowings across Runeterra in search of the fragments of her soul. Karma would defend the Lasting Altar against one of these Harrowings, but was nearly overwhelmed and corrupted by the king. The Harrowing would subside, when Viego obtained a soul fragment from Senna , but Karma would be left influenced by the king's magic. Karma would eventually come into possession of one of the fetters of Queen Isolde's soul, a silver flower.\nThe King would soon continue his search, with aid from his Yordle companion, Vex , by unleashing a global Harrowing, spreading Black Mist across Runeterra. The Sentinels of Light would arrive in Ionia in search of the fragment and were guided to the Lasting Altar by Irelia . Karma proposed hiding the fetter within an ancient Vastayan groves, guarded by ancient magics that not even the Black Mist could penetrate. As they prepared to leave, they would be ambushed by an army of Mistwalkers, the Sentinels and Irelia would hold off the ghouls while Karma fled towards the grove.\nThe Sentinels would catch up to Karma and they escorted her towards the grove, she began to express regret at not having done more during the Noxian invasion. Karma's regret caused her become susceptible to the influence of the Black Magic and she began to become ruined. Now under the sway of the Ruined King, she would attempt to flee with the fetter, but the Sentinels intercepted her. They manage to incapacite and momentarily purify her, she then reveals the King's plan, to use the fragments of the queen's soul to resurrect her. They are soon spotted by another hoard of ghouls, Karma gives the Sentinels the fetter and tells them to leave her as she succumbs to the Black Mist again. Karma would then become fully corrupted by the Black Mist and become an agent of Viego.\nShe and Draven would accompany the Ruined King to Shurima to search for another fetter. She, alongside the other corrupted champions, would face off against the Sentinels of Light when they mounted their final assault against the Shadow Isles. Viego would resurrect Isolde, but would be to rest again by Akshan and his Absolver. The Sentinels imprisoned Viego within Hallow Mist in Camavor. With Viego defeated, his corruption would subside and Karma and others would be free from the Ruined King's influence.\nKarma is a tall, slim and curvaceous young woman with slightly brown skin, short brown hair and emerald green eyes, she wears makeup with marks under her eyes, dark red lipstick, dark eye shadow and wears a kind of golden headband with a gem. aquamarine green in the center.\nHer clothes consist of a long Ionian dress with different shades of purple and violet colors, with golden lines that run through the entire dress, it has a white sash that is tightened with a purple bow, its right side has a long sleeve and the leg is exposed and her left side has an exposed arm and a purple sock on her left leg.\nKarma is depicted as a wise and compassionate individual with a strong sense of responsibility and duty. As an ancient spirit of Ionia, she has guided the Ionian people for generations, taking on various human incarnations throughout history. Karma is known for her wisdom and guidance. She carries the collective memories and experiences of her past lives, which allows her to offer valuable insights and advice to those around her. Her guidance is often sought in times of uncertainty or conflict. Despite her commitment to peace, Karma experiences an internal conflict when faced with the brutality of war. Her struggle to balance her desire for harmony with the need for action and protection. She grapples with the ethical dilemma of whether to remain pacifist in the face of conflict or take more direct action to protect her people."}

The assailant reveals himself to be her father Marcus, who had in fact faked his own death on Swain's order. He tells of his undercover work in Demacia , and that Swain changed the plan to give Katarina her biggest assignment yet: a covert assassination of King Jarvan III , as well as the noble Luxanna Crownguard , during the chaos of Sylas ' Mage Rebellion . Mistrustful of Swain, Marcus advised Katarina that the Grand General had betrayed them both and sent her on a suicide mission to ruin the standing of house Du Couteau. Still, Katarina decided to follow through, as her success would be undeniable merit against any potential persecution.\nUpon finding Lux, Katarina decided against killing her, as she sympathized with the lady's rejection against her family and the current Demacian regime. Nonetheless, she judged Jarvan III to be both a tyrant and a traitor to his people, as he oppressed mages just because they had the strength to overthrow him. She killed the king and escaped undetected by the surviving Demacian guards, who then pinned the assassination on Sylas. However, her escape from the city was interrupted by Garen , who received a tip that she was a mage helping Sylas.

It is revealed that Captain Jaredan was responsible for the shot; he was part of the undercover assassination, but had secret orders to sabotage Katarina.\nKatarina miraculously survived the fall, but one of her daggers had shattered.

Before he could deal the fatal blow with Katarina's dagger, she took her broken dagger and cut his eye. After this, Katarina decides to spare Talon. As she turns to leave, she assured she never held a grudge against him for scarring her face and wished that he would break off from father's legacy towards his own path. She left the house vowing that she to kill Talon if he chose not to heed her advice.\nThe next morning, Katarina and Drann performed a blood-bonding ritual to link her to her new blades, enabling her to teleport to the weapons and vice versa.

In a desperate attempt to finish the job, Marcus decided to sacrifice himself by priming a devastating Wolf's Maw explosive. Katarina swiftly flew her dagger to knock the charge from his hand, and threw her blade as far as she could into the air, intending to teleport to it with the device before it could detonate. However, Swain unexpectedly intervened, seizing the explosive and redirecting the impending blast toward Marcus, instantly incinerating him. In the aftermath of the battle, Swain congratulated Katarina on her assignment, revealing it was a test to find his failsafe; the only person who could kill him if his demon would take control of him one day. Fully embracing her role as Swain's assassin, she eliminated Jaredan two months later in Northern Freljord .\nKatarina is portrayed as a slender woman with an athletic and feminine physique, she has peach skin, green eyes, and red lips, with her most prominent features being her long bright red hair and a scar on her left eye.\nShe usually wears a revealing assassin uniform made of black and gray leather and latex which reveals her abdomen with several dark blue Noxian tattoos, she wears leather heeled boots and a small leather jacket.\nAs heir to a house of assassins, Katarina had pursued her father's approval for many years but always remained short of his standards. Having lost the respect of her parents, Katarina developed her own ideals as a noxian. Rather than chase legacies, she would use her skills to make a Noxus that she believes in. She is a firm believer in individual merit, and recognizes the benefit of having allies, especially those of different skillsets. Therefore, she finds mutual appreciation under the Trifarix.\nAs an assassin, Katarina is an agile fighter, can quickly plan her strategies, and has a keen eye for the subtlest of clues. Behind these instincts, her personal code of conduct dictates how she would kill targets based on how honorable she regards them, also shows a somewhat flirtatious personality with Garen.\nIn contrast to Cassiopeia , Talon is the adopted son of Marcus Du Couteau. In youth, Talon was tasked with a mission by Katarina's father: to eliminate her. However, Katarina miraculously survived Talon's attempt, emerging from the encounter with a distinct scar across her left eye. This encounter created an unexpected bond between them, as both had failed in their respective missions.\nAfter their encounter, he adopted a nonchalant demeanor towards Katarina, assuming the role of her composed younger brother. Behind this facade, however, he secretly conspired with his adopted father to overthrow Jericho Swain , who had recently ascended to power. Talon nursed a deep-seated jealousy towards Katarina, who had been entrusted with the symbolic daggers of House Du Couteau, a clear indication of the rightful heir.\nUpon revealing his intentions, Katarina responded with unexpected empathy. She understood that Talon was merely a puppet, obediently carrying out her father's orders without question. The failed assassination attempt, rather than fostering animosity, prompted Katarina to reflect on her family dynamics. As she departed from Talon, she wished for him to break free from her father's control and forge his own destiny. However, with a resolute warning, she made it clear that if Talon remained shackled by her father's influence, she would be compelled to bring an end to him herself.\nKatarina interacts very little with her younger sister, Cassiopeia , since both live in different worlds. While Katarina was taught by her father, pushing her to learn the way of the blade, Cassiopeia took after their politically brilliant mother.\nKatarina and her father, Marcus Du Couteau , had a very strained relationship. According to Marcus, her daughter always seemed to fail him as an assassin. To him, she was to brash and killed with a sense of passion and not with a cold, mercilessness he believed was necessary for an assassin. Because of this he ordered a young Talon to kill his firstborn daughter. After multiple attempts on her life failed, she confronted her father. She told the general she had considered taking his head instead, but eventually decided—as much as she hated to admit it—that he had done the right thing in ordering her death. She had failed. Not just as an assassin, or as a daughter, but as a Noxian. She knew she had lost her father’s favor, and could never regain it. He would raise others in her place, simply to spite her. Still, she vowed to redeem herself, no matter the cost—to rededicate her talents to the empire, and to become the sinister weapon she always intended to be.\nAfter her father mysteriously disappeared in 993 AN , she starts taking orders from Swain . Three years later, he reveals himself to her, saying that Swain is going to send her on a mission to Demacia to die. After not only completing her mission successfully but coming out of it alive, she returns to Noxus . Realising that her father is trying to kill Swain, she immediatly moved to stop him.\nDuring their final confrontation, she says to her father that he always wanted her to fail, because he was afraid she would grow to be better then him.  As their battle came to a climax, Marcus tried to take both Katarina and Swain with him by using an explosive known as the \"Wolf's Maw\". Before it could detonate, Swain arrived to redirect the explosion to Marcus, instantly incinerating him.\nKatarina interacts very little with her mother, Soreana Du Couteau , since both live in different worlds.

After mentioning she saved his sister from capture, she suggested Garen should do the same. After some fierce clashes of steel, an explosion stops their battle. Both combantants agree that they don't have time for their scuffle. Garen and Katarina have a small moment, bonding over their shared grievances with their younger siblings. Before she leaves, Katarina says to Garen she sees a great future for Garen and his sister.\nWhile it is unclear that Garen has any intrest in Katarina, Katarina has some intrest in him. During her bonding ritual with her weapons, she focused on a moment when she was not trying to figure out every angle, where she just felt something and connected. The moment she chose was her first encounter with Garen, smiling faintly.\nAssigned the mission to assassinate Lux and King Jarvan III in Demacia, Katarina deviates from her orders after recognizing Lux's dissent from the corrupt Demacian hierarchy. Sympathizing with Lux's plight, seeing as both women had been rejected by their families. Katarina spares her life. Katarina also notes that she thinks Lux is a threat to the Demacian hierarchy and would actually make a good Noxian.\nInitially aligning herself with Swain after the coup that toppled Grand General Boram Darkwill, Katarina becomes one of Swain's most devoted assassins, eliminating political rivals and enforcing the new order. Despite a moment of mistrust when she learns of her father's faked death and Swain's alleged betrayal, Katarina chooses to continue working for Swain to secure her family's safety. During Katarina's battle against her father, Marcus Du Couteau, Swain, recognizing Katarina as his failsafe, intervenes to prevent her sacrifice, cementing her role as his trusted assassin.\nThe proprietor of a teahouse where Katarina seeks refuge and counsel, Drann, is a close friend and ally of Katarina's.

She and her twin sister Morgana were the protectors of Demacia for many years—until Kayle became disillusioned with the repeated failings of mortals, and abandoned this realm altogether. Still, legends are told of her punishing the unjust with her fiery swords, and many hope that she will one day return...\nKayle and her twin sister Morgana were born on Mount Targon during the height of the Rune Wars to Kilam and Mihira , the current Aspect of Justice. Due to Mihira ascending while pregnant, the sisters were born with a fraction of her celestial power. As the war raged on, Mihira's celestial power began to overshadow her personality and affections as she dedicated more and more of her time to her duties as an aspect. Fearing what Mihira was becoming, as well as the enemies drawn to her light, Kilam resolved to take their daughters to safety. He fled Targon with his children and they would sail to the land that would be known as Demacia .\nThe sisters grew to having distinct and clashing personalities. While Morgana was empathizing with the newly arrived refugees, Kayle argued about laws of the settlement because she knew the laws were meant to protect people.\nOne day, Mihira's sword would fell from the sky and clash into two. From that moment, feathered wings bursted from the sister's backs and remained, confirming the celestial magic would still remain inside them. In that moment, Kayle felt more connected to her mother than ever. While Morgana resented her gifts, Kayle embraced her new power. One day, the settlement was attacked, and the sisters flew to aid the people of Zeffira. While Kayle was busy dealing with the frontline attack, Morgana learned of a hidden wave of enemies attacking the city and left the frontlines to aid the citizens. After the battle Kayle, for a time, lost trust in her sister for leaving her on the battlefield. Since that day, they were hailed as the Winged Protectors.\nKayle and Morgana at the gates of ancient Demacia.\nKayle and Morgana put on their armors and helmets, and stood against an army before the city walls. They easily destroyed the first wave. Sensing the danger approaching in the skies, the Winged Protectors took flight without hesitation and engaged in a deadly battle with Aatrox , who managed to possess a new host. Aatrox was too powerful to be defeated physically for the sisters. As the last stand, Morgana left her sword behind, and stood against Aatrox, binding him with her chains of dark flame. Taking Morgana's sword, Kayle empowered her wings and sword with celestial flames and burned the mortal body of him, sealing Aatrox within his own blade.\nWarriors flocked to Kayle's banner at Silvermere's Peak, where she founded a judicator order to enforce the law, and hunted down rebels and reavers with equal fervor. Kayle allowed Morgana to rehabilitate wrongdoers who appeared humble enough to admit their guilt. However, some people in the Judicator Order and especially Ronas, one of Kayle's ardent disciples, decided to arrest Morgana and her followers when Kayle was bringing justice upon a distant kingdom ruled by a cruel, unrighteous king. In an attempt to protect her followers, Morgana conjured magical chains of fire and bound him until he fell dead. His death led to an outbreak of violent riot in the settlement.\nKayle and Morgana fighting in the sky above Demacia.\nWhen Kayle found out what happened, she became enraged and with her power she summoned divine fire to punish the sinners in the city and Ronas' killer. Morgana flew up to meet her, giving Kayle ultimatum that if she want smite this people, she should start from her sister.  The two dueled in the sky, each matching the other’s terrible blows and striking the buildings beneath them to rubble, and killing innocent people without realize. It seemed that one of them was eventually going to win but Morgana faltered because she and Kayle heard their father's screams and stopped fighting. Their father was mortally wounded, Morgana hurled her sword at Kayle through tears, and plunged to the surface like a meteorite to cradle her father.\nShe took her dying father in her arms, and in a sea of tears, cursed her heavenly inheritance for the destruction around her. A moment later, Kayle landed too, and between sobs Morgana asked her if the purification of mortals by smiting included her father. Kayle kept silent, grabbed Morgana's sword and thought about senseless violence that overtaken the city this day. Сrying because of loss, she soared into the heavens and flew to Mount Targon to find her mother, and swore that she would not allow emotions to dominate her,\nShe left Demacia to stand at her mother's side, and to seek for perfect, celestial clarity on Targon. Even though she has been absent from Demacia for many centuries, she has inspired Demacia's culture, law, and architecture. Many pray to the Protector in times of chaos, and hope that she might return, some pray that such a day will never come.\nWhile spending time at Targon Prime, she met Mihira ,  the current Aspect of Justice and her long-gone mother. With time spent on Targon, she seems to become more moderate towards emotions and mortality and stopped denying them. She also continue to ascend herself and fight the world-threatening problems if needed. She also seems to help some Shurimans in need of Aspect of Justice's help.

A Demacian noble was convinced that the Winged Protector was still alive, so he sent out rider to track her. After decades, the riders found a single white feather beneath Targon. A Lunari child, in the middle of the night, said that he saw a winged ghost, flying around the mountain. Yet, his mother did not believe him.\nMany centuries passed, Morgana heard a voice. A lonely, so distant prayer. She had no idea where it came from, but she was so sure that Kayle was praying to her. However, her prayers remained unanswered.\nKayle is a slim and relatively muscled woman with pale, slightly tanned skin, short cyan hair with a bang on the right side, burning sun-gold eyes with white pupils and pointy ears.

Kayle wore a helmet that covered her face when she was the Winged Protector, but after her journey to Targon and her ascension into a more powerful form, she stopped wearing it.\nKayle is an incarnation of justice. While her sister Morgana represents restorative justice and advocates for the repentant, Kayle represents retributive justice and punishes in the fair way possible those who committed crimes without mercy and without taking into account various factors about a person, such as motives, origin, social status, etc. Despite wanting to make the world more just and fighthing to protect innocents and righteous, her lack of empathy towards sinners and zeal makes her quite stoic and cold since she only seeks to punish sinners on an idealistic eye-to-eye level, without forgiveness.

He wields the sentient darkin weapon Rhaast , undeterred by its creeping corruption of his body and mind. There are only two possible outcomes: either Kayn bends the weapon to his will... or the malevolent blade consumes him completely, paving the way for the destruction of all Runeterra .\nNoxian by birth, Shieda Kayn was conscripted as a child soldier like many others. When he was no more than ten, he and his comrades were ordered to attack the province of Bahrl in Ionia . He and other young soldiers made up the vanguard of the attack. While Kayn’s young comrades fled or were cut down by the defenders before the Noxian regulars came in from the flank, Kayn showed no fear and survived to see the end of the battle.\nZed and his followers arrived on the battleground two days later. There, they found Kayn on the ground, leveling a sickle at Zed. The Master of Shadows saw potential in the boy and welcomed him into the Yánléi .\nAfter joining the order, the young Kayn was given food and a home to stay. Growing up training as an acolyte of the order, Kayn was able to master all the weapons given to him while other acolytes spent years training with a single weapon. By drinking the Tears of the Shadow, Kayn gained the ability to cloak himself in the shadows to stealthily assassinate enemies. He was able to spread fear among the survivors through his swift kills, using fear as his weapon. As Kayn's power and reputation grew, he gained hubristic ambitions that one day he could be more powerful than even Zed.\nKayn was later sent on a mission to Noxus as his final test: to procure a Darkin scythe recently uncovered in the Noxian city of Vindor to stop the weapon from being used against the Ionians. Accompanied by his fellow acolyte Nakuri, he used his shadow magic to sneak up on the three guards defending the noxtoraa, killing two of them before intimidating the last one, whom was killed by Nakuri. After killing several more Noxian soldiers, Kayn approached the weapon where he heard the Darkin Rhaast call to him from within the scythe. One of the Noxians snatched the scythe in desperation, and began to swing it uncontrollably at his comrades as Rhaast's corruption took over. Realizing that the legends were true, Kayn, using a shadow technique, possessed the soldier's body, where he witnessed the atrocities that Rhaast inflicted over millennia. However, instead of destroying it as ordered, he was tempted to wield the Darkin for himself. Ignoring Nakuri's pleas, Kayn took hold of Rhaast and underwent the same corruption, but Kayn was able to resist his will and control his enhanced power. After a final struggle against Nakuri, Kayn killed his fellow acolyte. Since then, Kayn now duels Rhaast over control over his own body, until one of them wins and seizes control.\nThese scenarios are not canon to the official timeline, but future possibilities that have been hinted at in the lore and gameplay.\nKayn is a young man with a thin, muscular build. He has black hair with a blue streak at the right side and a long braid on the back. He wears nothing but large, baggy pants with a rope around it and leather boots. Due to Rhaast's partial assimilation, his left arm has become bright red muscle with grey plating covering his shoulder, left pectoral and left eye. He has a blue tattoo spiraling around his right wrist. His right eye has a yellow iris, while his corrupted left eye has a dark red sclera and a glowing red iris.\nAs the Shadow Assassin , he now has pale white skin, glowing pupilless eyes and lacks the corruption on his body. He has dark blue tattoos on his eyes, torso and arms. His braided hair has been replaced with long-flowing hair with a larger blue streak.\nMolded by Noxian brutality and tempered in the Yánléi , Kayn carries a deep-seated resentment towards authority while harboring an unwavering confidence in his own abilities. His fearless demeanor masks a simmering anger and a burning desire to prove himself superior, both to his enemies and his mentors. Kayn's arrogance fuels his relentless pursuit of power, driving him to defy tradition and embrace the forbidden allure of the darkin, Rhaast . Yet, beneath his bravado lies a cunning intellect and a calculating nature, always seeking the most advantageous path towards  dominating over both his foes and his destiny.\nWhen Kayn was a child soldier, Zed saw the potential within him and recruited him to be a part of his order, feeding him and giving him a home. Kayn became Zed's favorite and most loyal disciple, trusting him enough to confide valuable information and hoping that Kayn would become the new leader of the Order of Shadow if something were to happen to him. Kayn refused to betray him when Kusho urged him to, because of how he saved him from a hopeless fate and gave him a new purpose in life. Despite his loyalty, Kayn's growing arrogance led him to believe that with Rhaast's power, he would even surpass Zed one day.\nKayn sees his wieldership of Rhaast as being his destiny, risking the Darkin's corruption to unlock his true potential. While Rhaast tries to manipulate him into embracing violence, Kayn defies him just as easily. They both fight against each other over control of his body, with Kayn intending to fully overpower Rhaast and claim his power for himself.\nKayn, along with Zed and other members of the Shadow Order, were attacked by Jhin.\nKayn may have a crush on Akali. She knows Kayn and finds him hot but too crazy for her taste.\nKusho manipulated Kayn into serving him and ordered him to kill Zed, but Kayn remained loyal to Zed due to the latter being his mentor whom gave him his new purpose in life.\nRoyce sympathizes with Kayn due to them both growing up as child soldiers of Noxus, considering Kayn as a \"brother in blood\".\nKayn fought against Master Yi and his Wuju disciples to obtain the 1 The Darkin Bloodletters that they were guarding."}

For centuries, he has used diplomacy—and force—to maintain the sacred balance in his adopted home of Ionia . Lightning fast and bearing the wisdom of a long and storied life, Kennen works with the Eye of Twilight, Shen, to protect the fragile harmony of the First Lands with a whirling storm of shuriken and devastating electrical energy.\nUnlike many of his kind, Kennen felt a dissonance within the vibrant chaos of his homeland, Bandle City . Seeking harmony and balance, Kennen ventured forth from the spirit realm millennia ago, drawn by an insatiable curiosity that led him to traverse the material realm.\nHis journey eventually brought him to the serene First Lands , where ancient wars that none now remember had scarred the landscape, leaving behind a people striving to rebuild amidst the echoes of conflict. Kennen found solace among the inhabitants of the First Lands , fascinated by their relentless pursuit of balance and tranquility. Over time, he became deeply woven into the fabric of First Lands, forsaking his ties to Bandle City as he embraced the mortal realm and its inhabitants.\nAs Kennen delved deeper into the affairs of the First Lands, now known as Ionia , he encountered malevolent entities from the spirit realm threatening the delicate equilibrium of the land. Alone, he valiantly battled these disturbances, but soon realized that mere combat was not enough to address the root cause of imbalance. It was then that he discovered the Kinkou , a fledgling order dedicated to preserving harmony between the realms.\nRecognizing the need for a unifying force within the order, Kennen proposed himself as an arbiter, a bridge between the introspective Eye of Twilight and the warlike Fist of Shadow. With his affability and diplomacy, he became the Kinkou's first Heart of the Tempest, working alongside the Eye and the Fist to pass judgment and maintain equilibrium.\nIn the tumultuous aftermath of the Noxian invasion, as Ionia teetered on the brink of collapse, the Kinkou found themselves torn apart by internal strife and external threats. Despite Kennen's efforts to guide the order through the chaos, the shadow of betrayal loomed large as Zed , a former acolyte, orchestrated a coup.\nIn the darkest hour of the Kinkou, Kennen stood steadfast, offering counsel to the new Eye of Twilight, Shen , as he grappled with the burdens of leadership. He urged the Fist of Shadow, Mayym, to recognize Akali , his protege, as a potential successor. Yet even his wisdom could not prevent Akali's eventual departure from the order, disillusioned by its perceived failure to confront Ionia's enemies.\nKennen receives an urgent plea for help from the acolytes of the Temple of Raishai , on the southern coast of Zhyun , whose temple has been corrupted by an unknown malevolent force . As he races through varied landscapes, Kennen reflects on the weight of this mission, especially since it involves saving his fellow Kinkou members.\nArriving at the temple, Kennen discovers that the corruption lies not in the physical structure but within the acolytes themselves. They have become vessels for dark entities, fueled by their anguish and despair over the Kinkou's past decisions of non-intervention during times of conflict. Despite their loyalty to the order, their unresolved emotions have allowed these malevolent forces to take hold.\nIn a poignant moment, Kennen confronts the acolytes, gently revealing the truth of their condition and offering them a path to healing by releasing them from their Kinkou duties. However, some of the acolytes resist, seeing this as a dishonorable act and challenging Kennen. Using his lightning powers, Kennen incapacitates those who resist, not with the intent to harm but to break through their defenses and help them understand the necessity of leaving the order for their own well-being. Through his actions, Kennen not only dispels the immediate threat but also offers the acolytes a chance to find peace and balance once more.\nAs the former acolytes depart, Kennen reflects on the bittersweet nature of their departure, knowing that it was necessary for their own good and the greater harmony of the world. Despite the sorrow of parting ways, Kennen is resolved to carry their story forward, honoring their sacrifice and ensuring that their struggles are not forgotten.\nKennen is a  cream furred yordle with light brown hair and deep blue eyes.

Initially a mindless beast, Kha'Zix's intelligence has developed as much as its form. Now, the creature plans out its hunts, and even utilizes the visceral terror it engenders in its victims.\nKha'Zix was born like almost all Voidborn as a product of the Watchers manipulating organic matter to create servants to infiltrate the Runeterra and provide intel for them. Kha'Zix is a particular Voidborn, a vicious creature seeking to become the ultimate predator in service to the Watchers. At birth, Kha'Zix began as fragile and ravenous, feeding on smaller, weaker creatures that wouldn't allow him to adapt and evolve fast enough. Desiring more, Kha'Zix hunted down more dangerous creatures, risking his life to satisfy his need to consume and evolve. Kha'Zix feasted on every kill, consuming their biological essence and eventually becoming a near-perfect predator roaming the jungles and devouring all types of creatures.\nRoaming the jungles and savannahs near Shurima , Kha'Zix would encounter some members of a vastayan tribe known as the Kiilash ; a culture of fearsome hunters living within the jungles. At some point Ponjaf, the tribe's chieftain at the time, would witness the terrifying Kha'Zix but unable to kill him.

While stealthily watching the creature from the trees, Rengar finally lunges for an attack but acts too swiftly, as Kha'Zix is capable of parrying his hunting knife and slashing at his left eye with his claws. Rengar, now missing an eye, sees Kha'Zix hold it up with his claws and devour it tauntingly at Rengar.

Because of this defining encounter against the Kiilash hunter, Kha'Zix now sees Rengar as his next target to consume and eventually evolve into a more perfect predator.\nKha'Zix, the VoidReaver, is a terrifying embodiment of evolution and adaptation. He is a bipedal creature that stalks on clawed feet, his hunched posture conveys the image of a constant threat of violence. His body is encased in a chitinous exoskeleton, the colors of which reflect the unnatural hues of the Void - a chilling mix of purples, blacks, and occasionally disturbing swings of green. Glowing red eyes pierce the darkness of his head, which can take on insectoid or vaguely reptilian features.

These blades can be smooth and deadly or transformed into serrated instruments of destruction.\nWhen Kha'Zix was created, he was a vicious but unintelligent voidborn that only knew how to kill and eat. However, his mutating abilities allowed Kha'Zix to develop a growing sentience, complete with an intelligent mind, fearless attitude, and a sadistic sense of humor. Kha'Zix has a lot of pride, seeking out \"worthy prey\" in hopes that he can grow stronger than them and eventually kill them, which was the origin for his rivalry with Rengar, as their previous battle was a stalemate and Kha'Zix now considers him an equal. While hunting the Pridestalker may not be such a wise decision on the surface, Kha'Zix remains determined in his goal, whether it be from arrogance or just as a result of his programming as a Voidborn to seek out and kill the strongest creatures\nAt some point, Rengar as sent to bring back Kha'Zix's  head as a trophy, being the only way Rengar could truly regain honor and return to his people he got exiled from.

While hunting the Pridestalker may not be such a wise decision on the surface, Kha'Zix remains determined in his goal, whether it be from arrogance or just as a result of his programming as a Voidborn to seek out and kill the strongest creatures\nAt some point, Rengar as sent to bring back Kha'Zix's  head as a trophy, being the only way Rengar could truly regain honor and return to his people he got exiled from. They fought from sunset to sunrise. Finally, near death, they reluctantly separated.  Kha'Zix now  hungers most to conquer and consume Rengar, the one beast he considers his equal."}

Though interpretations of Kindred's nature vary across Runeterra , every mortal must choose the true face of their death.\nAs a spirit who is closer to a force of nature than a living being, it is difficult to tell how Kindred came to be who they are today. However, one of the many legends surrounding the origins of the Kindred tell of 'a pale man with dark hair' (Runeterra's own Grim Reaper ) who was 'very lonely' and so split himself 'right down the middle' so he 'would always have a friend'. Assuming there is some fact to this tale, one can extrapolate that his emotions (materialized in his dark hair) became Wolf, while his rationale (materialized in his pale self) became Lamb.\nKindred is an entity, with two distinct aspects and appearances:\nLamb, as her name would suggest, looks like a sheep/lamb with pale fur and lamb's legs and feet.

She carries with her a mystical bow.\nWolf, as his name would suggest, has the appearance of a spectral wolf with dark fur and only the head being visible. He wears no clothes, the rest of his body is covered in a long, spectral dark veil. The most distinctive ornament on his attire is the \"lamb\" mask which is white in color.\nIn the beginning, Kindred was a single being, isolated from the others due to their nature as a god of death. Lonely and craving companionship, they took an axe and cut themself in half dividing them in two beings, Lamb and Wolf. Both deeply attached to each other.\nLamb is the calm marksman that swiftly and painlessly ends the life of those that accept death by shooting them down with a single well aimed arrow, if they run away from their fate, they will find themselves in the maw of Wolf. Lamb appears to be Kindred's decision maker often the one pointing Wolf towards their goal and is often the one explaining the emotions of others to Wolf. Despite being calmer and less prone to violence than Wolf, Lamb is noticeably more apathetic towards others.\nWolf is the bestial half of the Kindred, representing a violent death. Those who will not fall to Lamb's arrows doom themselves to Wolf's jaws as he goes on the chase. Always hungry, he feels emotion but does not truly understand it - the counterpart to Lamb's impassive knowledge of feelings. The Kindred stalk the world, bringing peaceful death to those who will fall by Lamb.

In Spirit Bonds , it was implied certain parts of the Grey Man still exist somewhere in the Spirit Realm.\nAs a god of deaths, Kindred is related to all other representations of deaths in Runeterra. Legends say 2 Mask Mother created Kindred. While it's unknown how true the story is, both Lamb and Wolf call her their mother.

Many claim Kled has fought in every campaign the warhosts have waged, acquired every military title, and never once backed down from a fight. Though the truth of the matter is often questionable, one part of his legend is always the same: charging into battle on his un-trusty steed, Skaarl , Kled fights to protect what's his... and takes whatever else he can get.\n(TBA)\n(TBA)\nKled is a stereotypical hillbilly, with a distaste for \"city folk\" and a fierce sense of independence from society. Paranoid and territorial, Kled views all of Noxus as his property, and will gladly kill anyone he views as a trespasser. Though Kled doesn't answer to the Trifarix , he has fought alongside and inspired Noxian forces with his fearless and violent attitude for many centuries, and has been decorated with many honors. Because of his military titles (which may or may not be made up), Kled takes pride in his accomplishments and uses them as a means to prove his superiority over others.\nKled is very unfriendly, cursing often and is prone to violent outbursts and shouting. Kled shows a greedy side with his insistence on claiming land, and often places signs marking \"Property of Kled\" whenever he thinks something is his. Because of his short temper, he constantly berates his Drakalops steed, Skaarl , for her cowardly and unreliable nature. However, Kled does have a soft spot for his untrusty steed, and is overjoyed whenever she returns to help him in battle. Because of his chaotic nature, others often wonder if Kled is mentally-unstable.\nKled fought together with Sion back when Sion still lived, but doesn't think much of the new undead abomination.\nKled considers everyone (including himself, bizarrely) his rival and he sees Skaarl as his only friend.

Many claim Kled has fought in every campaign the warhosts have waged, acquired every military title, and never once backed down from a fight. Though the truth of the matter is often questionable, one part of his legend is always the same: charging into battle on his un-trusty steed, Skaarl , Kled fights to protect what's his... and takes whatever else he can get.\n(TBA)\n(TBA)\nKled is a stereotypical hillbilly, with a distaste for \"city folk\" and a fierce sense of independence from society. Paranoid and territorial, Kled views all of Noxus as his property, and will gladly kill anyone he views as a trespasser. Though Kled doesn't answer to the Trifarix , he has fought alongside and inspired Noxian forces with his fearless and violent attitude for many centuries, and has been decorated with many honors. Because of his military titles (which may or may not be made up), Kled takes pride in his accomplishments and uses them as a means to prove his superiority over others.\nKled is very unfriendly, cursing often and is prone to violent outbursts and shouting. Kled shows a greedy side with his insistence on claiming land, and often places signs marking \"Property of Kled\" whenever he thinks something is his. Because of his short temper, he constantly berates his Drakalops steed, Skaarl , for her cowardly and unreliable nature. However, Kled does have a soft spot for his untrusty steed, and is overjoyed whenever she returns to help him in battle. Because of his chaotic nature, others often wonder if Kled is mentally-unstable.\nKled fought together with Sion back when Sion still lived, but doesn't think much of the new undead abomination.\nKled considers everyone (including himself, bizarrely) his rival and he sees Skaarl as his only friend.

Using her magic to mirror herself, the sorceress can appear to anyone, anywhere, and even be in many places at once. Always plotting just out of sight, LeBlanc's true motives are as inscrutable as her shifting identity.\nMore than a thousand years ago, Leblanc was a member of the inner-circle cabal of mages of the infamous Iron Revenant . During the height of his reign, LeBlanc conspired with the barbarian Noxii tribes and their god to bring him down. With this alliance, LeBlanc would betray her master, severing his ties to the Immortal Bastion and allowing the united noxii tribes to invade it. She also helped seal Mordekaiser's personal hound demons, 6 Tybaulk and another unnamed shadow demon.\nThis alliance between Leblanc and Vladimir would lay the foundations for the Black Rose cabal.\nOver the centuries, others would join the Black Rose in its political schemes, like powerful nobles, exalted masters of magic, and beings darker still. This hidden cabal would guide  the throne of Noxus for more than a thousand years, orchestrating many of the empire’s most ambitious campaigns.\nOne of those nobles was named Lady Elise . LeBlanc, seeing in her a certain cunning and ruthlessness, would approach the poisoned, bedridden woman with the offer of joining the Black Rose . In an attempt to prove her worth, Elise would set sail to the Shadow Isles in order to find an esteemed item for the cabal, only to be mutated into a half-spider creature under the control of Vilemaw , the spider king.\nLeBlanc saw this as a opportunity to travel to the Isles in safety. And thus began the pact between the two women, she would give Elise acolytes for sacrifice and in turn she would bring powerful artifacts from the isles. This deal would endure centuries until the present days.\nDuring the final days of the First Demacian-Noxian War , LeBlanc spearheaded the resurrection of the national noxian hero Sion , although he was deemed uncontrollable by the Grand General and was locked inside his own statue.\nIn time, Leblanc would manipulate and control the next candidate for the throne of Noxus: Boram Darkwill . The Black Rose aided in his bid for the throne, but when he took control, he refused the Black Rose's advisors, and Leblanc took drastic measures. She manipulated a young nobleman into revealing the cabal and having it appear that the most prominent conspirators, along with Leblanc herself, were executed.\nYears later, Leblanc would once again contact an aging Boram Darkwill. Paranoid about his aging body, Darkwill caved into Leblanc's demands. Once again, Leblanc had control of the throne. She sent the nobleman that she had manipulated all those years ago to die in the war against Ionia , and it ended with Swain crippled and cast out. However, Swain came back. In the Immortal Bastion had lied a power that many had tried and failed to obtain: the power of Raum. Swain had found a way to use Raum to his own benefit, and with the knowledge, powers, and restored physical form that it gave him, he staged a coup and took over the throne in one night.\nIn 987 AN, LeBlanc noticed the unusual talent and magic of a Noxian girl named Rell , so she approached the family of the girl with an offer. She would induct the girl to Roseguard Academy, a hidden school of magical young-lings. She had the intention to strengthen the girl's magic so one day she could face Noxus’ most hated, ancient foe . She would grant Rell's mother the headmistress position of the Academy and continued to oversee the procedure until 986 AN when Rell escaped the academy.\nIn 996 AN, LeBlanc demanded 2 Tifalenji to return Riven 's runic blade back to her, threatening to take her life if she didn't bring it back.\nOn the same year, LeBlanc took the form of a tattoo artist and kept an eye on Samira . Later, she revealed herself to 6 Indari , Samira 's mentor, and declared the Black Rose has plans for her.\nIn 997 AN, one year after the Death of 7 Jarvan III , the relationship between Demacia and Nockmirch lacked communication thanks to the turmoil of the Mage Rebellion . LeBlanc took advantage of this and created a clone of Garen 's great-uncle Hargold in order to pressure Lord Eldwyn to side with Noxus. Her efforts ended up falling and Nockmirch renewed its truce with Demacia.\nLeBlanc is a slender with dark purple shoulder length hair, golden eyes and pallor skinned woman, hence her moniker The Pale Woman. She wears notorious noble raiment with a distinct purple, black and gold palette. The most distinct ornament on her attire is her golden three point crown. She also owns a metallic staff with floating jewels on its tip.\nLeblanc is a deceptive individual, often using her sorcery to trick, confuse, or convince people into serving her and the interests of the Black Rose. Leblanc is also clever, using all manner of methods to serve the interests of her and the Black Rose. Her ultimate goal is to have control of Noxus, whether publicly or by proxy.\nAlthough she seeks the striving of herself and her coven, LeBlanc never takes the spotlight of her schemes. Instead, she manipulates others to do the dirty work for her, as she convinces them through their little struggles as she sees the big picture.\nLeBlanc was forced to work for Mordekaiser, whose downfall she would later plan. To secure the The Immortal Bastion , she has designed battle plans against the revenant's eventual return.\nLeBlanc knows Veigar , who was in Mordekaiser's inner circle. [ 1 ]\nLeBlanc is the Matron of the Black Rose , whose members include Cassiopeia , Elise and Vladimir .\nLeBlanc tasks Elise with bearing magical artifacts for her from Shadow Isles and in exchange, she gives Elise acolytes to offer as sacrifices to Vilemaw .\nSion was resurrected under the help of the Black Rose, likely at LeBlanc's command.\nLeBlanc assisted Boram Darkwill's rise to Grand Generalship, but when he refused to be Leblanc's puppet, she orchestrated a revealing of the Black Rose, manipulating Jericho Swain into revealing the Black Rose and its members. She then staged a fake execution of herself. [ 2 ] However, in the later years of Darkwill's life, Leblanc seduced him to her will once again with the promise of extending his mortal lifespan.\nWhen Darkwill refused to follow Leblanc's orders after ascending to the throne, Leblanc manipulated Swain into revealing the Black Rose and its members, including his own parents. In the later years of Darkwill's life, Leblanc and Darkwill sent Swain into a battle in Ionia knowing he would lose, leaving Swain crippled. After Swain's takeover of the Noxian government and the establishment of the Trifarix , Leblanc has spent all of her time (multiplied by her many doppelgangers) plotting Swain's destruction. [ 3 ]\nLeBlanc has a special interest in Samira.\nLeBlanc secretly trained Rell as a weapon specifically against Mordekaiser.\nRiven's blade was enchanted by LeBlanc herself. LeBlanc later sent a small warband that included Riven's old team mates to bring her and the blade back to Noxus.\nLeBlanc may be plotting a war between Demacia and Noxus at the moment, with either one of her Black Rose spies or even a clone of herself having encountered Garen and Quinn in the process.

Using her magic to mirror herself, the sorceress can appear to anyone, anywhere, and even be in many places at once. Always plotting just out of sight, LeBlanc's true motives are as inscrutable as her shifting identity.\nMore than a thousand years ago, Leblanc was a member of the inner-circle cabal of mages of the infamous Iron Revenant . During the height of his reign, LeBlanc conspired with the barbarian Noxii tribes and their god to bring him down. With this alliance, LeBlanc would betray her master, severing his ties to the Immortal Bastion and allowing the united noxii tribes to invade it. She also helped seal Mordekaiser's personal hound demons, 6 Tybaulk and another unnamed shadow demon.\nThis alliance between Leblanc and Vladimir would lay the foundations for the Black Rose cabal.\nOver the centuries, others would join the Black Rose in its political schemes, like powerful nobles, exalted masters of magic, and beings darker still. This hidden cabal would guide  the throne of Noxus for more than a thousand years, orchestrating many of the empire’s most ambitious campaigns.\nOne of those nobles was named Lady Elise . LeBlanc, seeing in her a certain cunning and ruthlessness, would approach the poisoned, bedridden woman with the offer of joining the Black Rose . In an attempt to prove her worth, Elise would set sail to the Shadow Isles in order to find an esteemed item for the cabal, only to be mutated into a half-spider creature under the control of Vilemaw , the spider king.\nLeBlanc saw this as a opportunity to travel to the Isles in safety. And thus began the pact between the two women, she would give Elise acolytes for sacrifice and in turn she would bring powerful artifacts from the isles. This deal would endure centuries until the present days.\nDuring the final days of the First Demacian-Noxian War , LeBlanc spearheaded the resurrection of the national noxian hero Sion , although he was deemed uncontrollable by the Grand General and was locked inside his own statue.\nIn time, Leblanc would manipulate and control the next candidate for the throne of Noxus: Boram Darkwill . The Black Rose aided in his bid for the throne, but when he took control, he refused the Black Rose's advisors, and Leblanc took drastic measures. She manipulated a young nobleman into revealing the cabal and having it appear that the most prominent conspirators, along with Leblanc herself, were executed.\nYears later, Leblanc would once again contact an aging Boram Darkwill. Paranoid about his aging body, Darkwill caved into Leblanc's demands. Once again, Leblanc had control of the throne. She sent the nobleman that she had manipulated all those years ago to die in the war against Ionia , and it ended with Swain crippled and cast out. However, Swain came back. In the Immortal Bastion had lied a power that many had tried and failed to obtain: the power of Raum. Swain had found a way to use Raum to his own benefit, and with the knowledge, powers, and restored physical form that it gave him, he staged a coup and took over the throne in one night.\nIn 987 AN, LeBlanc noticed the unusual talent and magic of a Noxian girl named Rell , so she approached the family of the girl with an offer. She would induct the girl to Roseguard Academy, a hidden school of magical young-lings. She had the intention to strengthen the girl's magic so one day she could face Noxus’ most hated, ancient foe . She would grant Rell's mother the headmistress position of the Academy and continued to oversee the procedure until 986 AN when Rell escaped the academy.\nIn 996 AN, LeBlanc demanded 2 Tifalenji to return Riven 's runic blade back to her, threatening to take her life if she didn't bring it back.\nOn the same year, LeBlanc took the form of a tattoo artist and kept an eye on Samira . Later, she revealed herself to 6 Indari , Samira 's mentor, and declared the Black Rose has plans for her.\nIn 997 AN, one year after the Death of 7 Jarvan III , the relationship between Demacia and Nockmirch lacked communication thanks to the turmoil of the Mage Rebellion . LeBlanc took advantage of this and created a clone of Garen 's great-uncle Hargold in order to pressure Lord Eldwyn to side with Noxus. Her efforts ended up falling and Nockmirch renewed its truce with Demacia.\nLeBlanc is a slender with dark purple shoulder length hair, golden eyes and pallor skinned woman, hence her moniker The Pale Woman. She wears notorious noble raiment with a distinct purple, black and gold palette. The most distinct ornament on her attire is her golden three point crown. She also owns a metallic staff with floating jewels on its tip.\nLeblanc is a deceptive individual, often using her sorcery to trick, confuse, or convince people into serving her and the interests of the Black Rose. Leblanc is also clever, using all manner of methods to serve the interests of her and the Black Rose. Her ultimate goal is to have control of Noxus, whether publicly or by proxy.\nAlthough she seeks the striving of herself and her coven, LeBlanc never takes the spotlight of her schemes. Instead, she manipulates others to do the dirty work for her, as she convinces them through their little struggles as she sees the big picture.\nLeBlanc was forced to work for Mordekaiser, whose downfall she would later plan. To secure the The Immortal Bastion , she has designed battle plans against the revenant's eventual return.\nLeBlanc knows Veigar , who was in Mordekaiser's inner circle. [ 1 ]\nLeBlanc is the Matron of the Black Rose , whose members include Cassiopeia , Elise and Vladimir .\nLeBlanc tasks Elise with bearing magical artifacts for her from Shadow Isles and in exchange, she gives Elise acolytes to offer as sacrifices to Vilemaw .\nSion was resurrected under the help of the Black Rose, likely at LeBlanc's command.\nLeBlanc assisted Boram Darkwill's rise to Grand Generalship, but when he refused to be Leblanc's puppet, she orchestrated a revealing of the Black Rose, manipulating Jericho Swain into revealing the Black Rose and its members. She then staged a fake execution of herself. [ 2 ] However, in the later years of Darkwill's life, Leblanc seduced him to her will once again with the promise of extending his mortal lifespan.\nWhen Darkwill refused to follow Leblanc's orders after ascending to the throne, Leblanc manipulated Swain into revealing the Black Rose and its members, including his own parents. In the later years of Darkwill's life, Leblanc and Darkwill sent Swain into a battle in Ionia knowing he would lose, leaving Swain crippled. After Swain's takeover of the Noxian government and the establishment of the Trifarix , Leblanc has spent all of her time (multiplied by her many doppelgangers) plotting Swain's destruction. [ 3 ]\nLeBlanc has a special interest in Samira.\nLeBlanc secretly trained Rell as a weapon specifically against Mordekaiser.\nRiven's blade was enchanted by LeBlanc herself. LeBlanc later sent a small warband that included Riven's old team mates to bring her and the blade back to Noxus.\nLeBlanc may be plotting a war between Demacia and Noxus at the moment, with either one of her Black Rose spies or even a clone of herself having encountered Garen and Quinn in the process. [ 4 ]\nIt is implied that LeBlanc was involved in the capture of Jarvan IV by the Noxian army, based on the flavor text of 7 King Jarvan III .\nHer interactions with 8 Incisive Tactician and 2 Black Rose Spy mentioning \"golden crowns\" suggest that LeBlanc might have been involved in the death of 7 King Jarvan III ."}

Her skin shimmers with starfire while her eyes burn with the power of the celestial Aspect within her. Armored in gold and bearing a terrible burden of ancient knowledge, Leona brings enlightenment to some, death to others.\nLeona was born to Sunforgers Iasur and Melia within the Rakkor tribes of Mount Targon . Along with her younger siblings Aidonel and Kespina, Leona was raised since birth to honor the faith of the Solari , a religious sect of the Rakkor that highly venerated the sun.\nLeona took to the Solari faith as easily as breathing, proving excellence in capability, willpower and devotion to the faith. Leona's faith and skill was so strong that her peers grew jealous, as nobody had doubts that she would one day become one of the elite Ra'Horak warriors of the Solari.\nOne day, the Solari took in a young orphan named Diana , who did not follow the Solari's values as easily and instead preferred the moon and the night. The Solari punished Diana constantly and called her a heretic for her blasphemy, but Leona felt pity for her and saw her as a lost soul searching for meaning.\nOne night, Diana confided a secret to Leona and spoke of the hidden alcove she discovered in the mountain, an ancient place where the walls depicted strange imagery of the moon and forgotten societies dressed in silver armor, proving that the sun and the moon were in fact not enemies at all. Noticing the heresy of what Diana described, she urged her to abandon this search and never speak of her discoveries, seeking to protect Diana from the brutal punishments of the other Solari if they heard of what she found. Diana reluctantly promised Leona that she'd abandon her discoveries and the two never spoke of it again as time passed, while Leona believed that her friend finally came to her senses.\nOn one fateful night, Leona caught a glimpse of Diana sneaking out of the temple. Though Leona's first instincts was to tell the elders, she instead decided to protect her friend from their punishments and set off to follow her into the night.\nFollowing Diana, Leona ascended Mount Targon itself and endured a brutal trial unlike anything she'd ever faced before as every fiber of her being was tested to its limits. As she passed frozen bodies embedded into the mountain's slopes, Leona continued her journey and endured thanks to her training, willpower and drive to protect Diana.\nMiraculously, to Leona's surprise, she finally reached the peak of the mountain after what felt like an eternity. Exhausted and beholding an uncanny landscape at the peak, she found Diana engulfed in a column of silver light, writhing in agony to Leona's horror. As she rushed to her aid, a second, golden column of light burst from the heavens, fell on her and enveloped her entire body.\nLeona felt the sun's powers course through her and sear away her very being, but her indomitable will allowed her to retain her consciousness. Leona expected to be incinerated but instead emerged the new Host for the 6 Aspect of the Sun , realizing that she was destined to protect the Solari in dire times to come.\nDiana also emerged as a new Aspect of 6 the Moon , now clad in silver armor that reflected the golden armor Leona found herself wearing. Diana was overjoyed that the two of them became Aspects together and begged Leona to join her on a new quest to find answers outside of the Solari faith, but Leona demanded that they return home and present themselves for the priests' judgements. The two argued and neither conceded as they engaged in swift combat utilizing their newfound powers. Diana eventually had her crescent blade at Leona's throat but refused to deal the killing blow and fled. Devastated, Leona descended the mountain without Diana and hurried to report to the elders.\nUnfortunately, when Leona arrived, she found many Solari priests and Ra'Horak guards slaughtered, seemingly by Diana's hands. The survivors emerged and awed at Leona's arrival, amazed by the arrival of not one but two Aspects among them. Now as the new Aspect of the Sun, Leona knew that great threats and changes were coming to Runeterra and vowed to act as a guiding light for her people serving as fierce leader.\nLeona continued to lead the Solari as an avatar of their faith and was eventually appointed as the commander for the entire Ra'Horak, gaining complete control and loyalty of all the Solari warriors. Though she seeks to preserve the religious dominance of the Solari, she has sworn to find and locate Diana in fear of what the Aspect of the Moon will do to her if she does not learn to control it.\n(TBA) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]\n(TBA) [ 5 ]\nLeona is a tall, beautiful woman with lightly tanned skin, light brown eyes and long back-length shiny auburn reddish hair.\nHer attire consists of red and gold Solari armor that covers her entire body, a spiked golden crown on her head, and she always carries her sword and shield.\nLeona is a devout and loyal Solari warrior, willing to give her life in the name of the sun and her people. She has an incredibly strong force of will, evidenced by her early schooling, the trials she undertook before being imbued by the Aspect of the Sun, and her commitment to guiding the Solari as host to the Aspect.\nShe is a warm soul, especially with Diana , who was her closest friend and lover before her betrayal at the peak of Mount Targon. Many Solari demanded Diana's head due to this betrayal, but Leona instead endeavors to help her control the Moon Aspect's power before it destroys her. She still loves Diana despite her betrayal, but is unable to bring herself to reconcile with her.\nDespite their disagreements, Diana and Leona were close friends and lovers growing up on Mount Targon, but have since became enemies after becoming Aspects. The two expressed romantic interest during the Festival of the Nightless Eve.\nLeona saw the moment Diana was imbued with the moon's power, she rushed to help before being imbued with the sun's power herself and made an Aspect.\nAtreus climbed Mount Targon to find the power of Aspects when Leona refused to destroy the trespassers that attacked his patrol. After he defeated Aatrox and became the new Aspect of War, he opposes her and other Targonian Aspects.\nLeona would not move against the Barbarians because she knew Aatrox was slaughtering them, which Atreus would only understand later on. [ 6 ]\nSoraka refers to Leona as \"Woman whose face burned like the sun\".\nAs the champion of the Solari , Alune sees Leona as the Lunari's ultimate enemy. However, like most of the Lunari , she is not necessarily hostile towards Leona or the Solari."}

Her skin shimmers with starfire while her eyes burn with the power of the celestial Aspect within her. Armored in gold and bearing a terrible burden of ancient knowledge, Leona brings enlightenment to some, death to others.\nLeona was born to Sunforgers Iasur and Melia within the Rakkor tribes of Mount Targon . Along with her younger siblings Aidonel and Kespina, Leona was raised since birth to honor the faith of the Solari , a religious sect of the Rakkor that highly venerated the sun.\nLeona took to the Solari faith as easily as breathing, proving excellence in capability, willpower and devotion to the faith. Leona's faith and skill was so strong that her peers grew jealous, as nobody had doubts that she would one day become one of the elite Ra'Horak warriors of the Solari.\nOne day, the Solari took in a young orphan named Diana , who did not follow the Solari's values as easily and instead preferred the moon and the night. The Solari punished Diana constantly and called her a heretic for her blasphemy, but Leona felt pity for her and saw her as a lost soul searching for meaning.\nOne night, Diana confided a secret to Leona and spoke of the hidden alcove she discovered in the mountain, an ancient place where the walls depicted strange imagery of the moon and forgotten societies dressed in silver armor, proving that the sun and the moon were in fact not enemies at all. Noticing the heresy of what Diana described, she urged her to abandon this search and never speak of her discoveries, seeking to protect Diana from the brutal punishments of the other Solari if they heard of what she found. Diana reluctantly promised Leona that she'd abandon her discoveries and the two never spoke of it again as time passed, while Leona believed that her friend finally came to her senses.\nOn one fateful night, Leona caught a glimpse of Diana sneaking out of the temple. Though Leona's first instincts was to tell the elders, she instead decided to protect her friend from their punishments and set off to follow her into the night.\nFollowing Diana, Leona ascended Mount Targon itself and endured a brutal trial unlike anything she'd ever faced before as every fiber of her being was tested to its limits. As she passed frozen bodies embedded into the mountain's slopes, Leona continued her journey and endured thanks to her training, willpower and drive to protect Diana.\nMiraculously, to Leona's surprise, she finally reached the peak of the mountain after what felt like an eternity. Exhausted and beholding an uncanny landscape at the peak, she found Diana engulfed in a column of silver light, writhing in agony to Leona's horror. As she rushed to her aid, a second, golden column of light burst from the heavens, fell on her and enveloped her entire body.\nLeona felt the sun's powers course through her and sear away her very being, but her indomitable will allowed her to retain her consciousness. Leona expected to be incinerated but instead emerged the new Host for the 6 Aspect of the Sun , realizing that she was destined to protect the Solari in dire times to come.\nDiana also emerged as a new Aspect of 6 the Moon , now clad in silver armor that reflected the golden armor Leona found herself wearing. Diana was overjoyed that the two of them became Aspects together and begged Leona to join her on a new quest to find answers outside of the Solari faith, but Leona demanded that they return home and present themselves for the priests' judgements. The two argued and neither conceded as they engaged in swift combat utilizing their newfound powers. Diana eventually had her crescent blade at Leona's throat but refused to deal the killing blow and fled. Devastated, Leona descended the mountain without Diana and hurried to report to the elders.\nUnfortunately, when Leona arrived, she found many Solari priests and Ra'Horak guards slaughtered, seemingly by Diana's hands. The survivors emerged and awed at Leona's arrival, amazed by the arrival of not one but two Aspects among them. Now as the new Aspect of the Sun, Leona knew that great threats and changes were coming to Runeterra and vowed to act as a guiding light for her people serving as fierce leader.\nLeona continued to lead the Solari as an avatar of their faith and was eventually appointed as the commander for the entire Ra'Horak, gaining complete control and loyalty of all the Solari warriors. Though she seeks to preserve the religious dominance of the Solari, she has sworn to find and locate Diana in fear of what the Aspect of the Moon will do to her if she does not learn to control it.\n(TBA) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]\n(TBA) [ 5 ]\nLeona is a tall, beautiful woman with lightly tanned skin, light brown eyes and long back-length shiny auburn reddish hair.\nHer attire consists of red and gold Solari armor that covers her entire body, a spiked golden crown on her head, and she always carries her sword and shield.\nLeona is a devout and loyal Solari warrior, willing to give her life in the name of the sun and her people. She has an incredibly strong force of will, evidenced by her early schooling, the trials she undertook before being imbued by the Aspect of the Sun, and her commitment to guiding the Solari as host to the Aspect.\nShe is a warm soul, especially with Diana , who was her closest friend and lover before her betrayal at the peak of Mount Targon. Many Solari demanded Diana's head due to this betrayal, but Leona instead endeavors to help her control the Moon Aspect's power before it destroys her. She still loves Diana despite her betrayal, but is unable to bring herself to reconcile with her.\nDespite their disagreements, Diana and Leona were close friends and lovers growing up on Mount Targon, but have since became enemies after becoming Aspects. The two expressed romantic interest during the Festival of the Nightless Eve.\nLeona saw the moment Diana was imbued with the moon's power, she rushed to help before being imbued with the sun's power herself and made an Aspect.\nAtreus climbed Mount Targon to find the power of Aspects when Leona refused to destroy the trespassers that attacked his patrol. After he defeated Aatrox and became the new Aspect of War, he opposes her and other Targonian Aspects.\nLeona would not move against the Barbarians because she knew Aatrox was slaughtering them, which Atreus would only understand later on. [ 6 ]\nSoraka refers to Leona as \"Woman whose face burned like the sun\".\nAs the champion of the Solari , Alune sees Leona as the Lunari's ultimate enemy. However, like most of the Lunari , she is not necessarily hostile towards Leona or the Solari."}

Hiding just out of sight of mortals—whose mysterious natures have long captivated, but intimidated, her—Lillia hopes to discover why their dreams no longer reach the ancient Dreaming Tree. She now travels Ionia with a magical branch in hand, in an effort to find people's unrealized dreams. Only then can Lillia herself bloom and help others untangle their fears to find the sparkle within. Eep!\nWhen the Freljordian barbarian Ivern the Cruel traveled to Omikayalan and cut down the God-Willow, several seeds of the ancient tree were dispersed and scattered around Ionia . One of these seeds took root in what would later be known as the Garden of Forgetting and, after being nurtured by the now reformed Green Father Ivern, sprouted into the Dreaming Tree; a [[Spirit Tree] that spread the magic of mortal desires by attracting and containing their dreams within dream-laden flower buds.\nWhen the Dreaming Tree began to have a dream of it's own, it manifested into a new bud that held this dream. This bud however fell to the ground prematurely, miraculously sprouting into Lillia; an awkward Fae Fawn creature with the flower bud from her birth still attached to her head. Having no company other than her mother tree and the many dreams that drifted to the garden each night, Lillia became a caretaker for the garden and helped her mother by tending to the buds containing the dreams and desires of humans.\nDuring this time, Lillia would learn more about the world outside the garden through these dreams, becoming enchanted by sights of people and places people dream of, experiencing the swirl of emotions in each one and seeing the desires that mortals only think of when they're asleep. Lillia began to feel a deep sense of care for these dreams and the dreamers that made them, longing to one day meet these many dreamers face-to-face. Lillia's dream to explore the world and meet these dreamers eventually manifested into a bud of it's own on a branch of the Dreaming Tree.\nAfter the Noxian Invasion of Ionia , fewer dreams began to arrive to the Garden of Forgetting, causing Lillia's mother tree to grew sick and infected with burls and dark ooze. Though Lillia did her best to nurture her mother tree and the remaining dreams contained in its buds, the Dreaming Tree only grew so sick it could no longer protect the garden from outsiders.\nOne night, around the time of the Spirit Blossom festival , a band of warriors chased a lone figure into the garden and all the way to the location of the Dreaming Tree itself. During a fight, the branch holding Lillia's own dream bud was cut down by a slash of the lone figure's blade, causing it to fall to the ground and frightening Lillia. Panicked, Lillia used dream dust and forced all the humans to fall asleep.\nHaving finally met her first humans, Lillia was shocked at how different they were compared to how they seemed from the wonderful dreams she would witness while tending to the garden, seeing them as tangled and confused just like the burls that infected her mother tree. While weeping from the sheer shock of the incident, Lillia noticed the lone figure's dream as it slowly floated toward the cut down branch and into the bud containing Lillia's own dream. Picking up the branch, Lillia soothed the dream within the bud, causing it and herself to grow brighter as the bud on her head unfurled and bloomed with magical sparkling pollen before sneezing and releasing the magic into the forest.\nAs the humans woke up, Lillia hid behind the tree and watched as they completely forgot how they got to the garden and what they were doing there before leaving. Though relieved to see them go, Lillia still saw the potential for dreams within these humans despite how tangled and violent they were on the surface.\nWhile caring for her mother tree, Lillia saw more dreams of mortals that depicted several Spirits of Ionian mythology. Through her encounter with the human warriors, Lillia realized that the only way she can truly save the Dreaming Tree is by bringing the dreams to the garden herself. Finally gaining the courage, Lillia took up her branch and left the garden to enter the unfamiliar and frightening world outside as she looked over an Ionian village celebrating the Spirit Blossom festival. [ 1 ]\nWhile shy and hiding just out of sight, Lillia now helps mortals realize their own dreams, bringing forward glimpses of the potential she sees in them. In doing so, Lillia realizes she's finally fulfilled her own dream to explore the world and meet these dreamers, occasionally causing the bud on her head to bloom with joy.\nOn one occasion, Lilia encounters a lonely girl in the forest. The girl's dream seems elusive until Lillia realizes it's not what the girl wants, but what she needs—a connection to her absent sister. Through a heartfelt exchange, Lillia helps the girl release her dream, teaching her the power of dreams to provide comfort and solace.\nAt some point, a large amount of dewdrops containing glimpses into dreams from all over Runeterra began to gather around the Dreaming Tree in preparation for a massive harvest. Lillia travelled back to the Garden of Forgetting to help nurture the dewdrops during the harvest, encountering the garden's other caretakers such as a Vastayan gardener of the Ophelis tribe named 3 Aisha . Along with that, the harvest attracted many 1 Spritelings watched over by the 4 Sprite Mother , who kept these fickle spirits in line as they entered others' dreams and guided the dreamers.\nLillia watching the Dreaming Tree as magical dewdrops begin to gather around it, ready for the harvest.\nDuring this harvest, Lillia saw into other dreams carried to the garden by the dewdrops. Looking into one dream, she saw the Yordle Vex attending a joyful birthday party planned by her 'friend' 3 Allay , which Vex considered more of a nightmare.\nLillia fighting off the corruption that took hold Lux's dream.\nLillia peered more closely into a different dream belonging to Luxanna Crownguard , who dreamt of a utopian version of Demacia where her magical gifts were celebrated rather than feared. During this wondrous dream however, Lillia witnessed it corrupt with darkness as Lux encountered a 5 mageseeker and walked into a 4 petricite hall filled with darkness and grasping hands. In an effort to save Lux and her dream of a better Demacia, Lillia fought off the corruption, which manifested in the form of mysterious crows.\nLux's dream was seemingly saved by a sprite who took the form of a young mage named 8 Alina .\nLillia is a pretty slender Fae Fawn , with brownish fur, long hair with a distinct palette of lilac and blue, large ears,big blue eyes and four deer legs. She doesn't wear clothes, just a plain top made of leaves with a green palette. The most distinctive ornament on her attire is the flower bud on her head. She also has the magical branch in hand. Despite looking similar to a Vastaya , Lillia is not one.\nLillia is a very shy and kind individual, but is also extremely protective and determined in her cause to help her Mother tree. She is very passionate and devoted to her mission to save the Mother tree's life. Lillia is very curious, with a broad imagination and an everlasting sense of wonder. She is both clumsy and competent.\nLillia's mother, the legendary Dreaming Tree, was directly spawned by the ancient God-Willow tree in Omikayalan . When Ivern, as a once human barbarian, cut down the God-Willow, he fused with it and became the legendary Green Father as he vowed to tend to and care for all nature and helped nurture many of the God-Willow's spawned seeds including Lillia's mother tree.\nDue to the fact that Ivern is essentially fused with the God-Willow and he took the effort to care for the Dreaming Tree, he's considered an ancestor or 'grandfather' figure to Lillia. Their relationship seems very warming, as Lillia states that Ivern sometimes considers her his \"favorite sprout.\"\nThough Lillia never directly interacted with Yasuo, it is implied that he could be the figure that fled into the Garden of Forgetting during her first ever encounter with humans.\nAt some point, Yone met Lillia developed a fond friendship with her, possibly when the two arrived at Weh'le during the Spirit Blossom festival . Yone, considering Lillia as one of the kinder spirits compared to the many Azakana he faces, has vowed to protect her from any dangers, particularly demons. [ 2 ]\nIt's unclear whether or not they have directly met, but Yone states that Nocturne is targeting Lillia and has vowed to stop him from ever crossing paths with her. It's very likely they are at least aware of one another though due to Nocturne's innate connection to nightmares."}

Through a heartfelt exchange, Lillia helps the girl release her dream, teaching her the power of dreams to provide comfort and solace.\nAt some point, a large amount of dewdrops containing glimpses into dreams from all over Runeterra began to gather around the Dreaming Tree in preparation for a massive harvest. Lillia travelled back to the Garden of Forgetting to help nurture the dewdrops during the harvest, encountering the garden's other caretakers such as a Vastayan gardener of the Ophelis tribe named 3 Aisha . Along with that, the harvest attracted many 1 Spritelings watched over by the 4 Sprite Mother , who kept these fickle spirits in line as they entered others' dreams and guided the dreamers.\nLillia watching the Dreaming Tree as magical dewdrops begin to gather around it, ready for the harvest.\nDuring this harvest, Lillia saw into other dreams carried to the garden by the dewdrops. Looking into one dream, she saw the Yordle Vex attending a joyful birthday party planned by her 'friend' 3 Allay , which Vex considered more of a nightmare.\nLillia fighting off the corruption that took hold Lux's dream.\nLillia peered more closely into a different dream belonging to Luxanna Crownguard , who dreamt of a utopian version of Demacia where her magical gifts were celebrated rather than feared. During this wondrous dream however, Lillia witnessed it corrupt with darkness as Lux encountered a 5 mageseeker and walked into a 4 petricite hall filled with darkness and grasping hands. In an effort to save Lux and her dream of a better Demacia, Lillia fought off the corruption, which manifested in the form of mysterious crows.\nLux's dream was seemingly saved by a sprite who took the form of a young mage named 8 Alina .\nLillia is a pretty slender Fae Fawn , with brownish fur, long hair with a distinct palette of lilac and blue, large ears,big blue eyes and four deer legs. She doesn't wear clothes, just a plain top made of leaves with a green palette. The most distinctive ornament on her attire is the flower bud on her head. She also has the magical branch in hand. Despite looking similar to a Vastaya , Lillia is not one.\nLillia is a very shy and kind individual, but is also extremely protective and determined in her cause to help her Mother tree. She is very passionate and devoted to her mission to save the Mother tree's life. Lillia is very curious, with a broad imagination and an everlasting sense of wonder. She is both clumsy and competent.\nLillia's mother, the legendary Dreaming Tree, was directly spawned by the ancient God-Willow tree in Omikayalan . When Ivern, as a once human barbarian, cut down the God-Willow, he fused with it and became the legendary Green Father as he vowed to tend to and care for all nature and helped nurture many of the God-Willow's spawned seeds including Lillia's mother tree.\nDue to the fact that Ivern is essentially fused with the God-Willow and he took the effort to care for the Dreaming Tree, he's considered an ancestor or 'grandfather' figure to Lillia. Their relationship seems very warming, as Lillia states that Ivern sometimes considers her his \"favorite sprout.\"\nThough Lillia never directly interacted with Yasuo, it is implied that he could be the figure that fled into the Garden of Forgetting during her first ever encounter with humans.\nAt some point, Yone met Lillia developed a fond friendship with her, possibly when the two arrived at Weh'le during the Spirit Blossom festival . Yone, considering Lillia as one of the kinder spirits compared to the many Azakana he faces, has vowed to protect her from any dangers, particularly demons. [ 2 ]\nIt's unclear whether or not they have directly met, but Yone states that Nocturne is targeting Lillia and has vowed to stop him from ever crossing paths with her. It's very likely they are at least aware of one another though due to Nocturne's innate connection to nightmares."}

The truth is perhaps more sinister, as she uses her elemental magic to twist the power of True Ice into something dark and terrible, entombing or impaling any who would reveal her deepest secrets. Indeed, the legacy of her past may yet be the beginning of the end for Runeterra.\nLissandra came into existence millennia ago, a time when the barriers between the tangible, physical world and other realms were hotly contested and beings of old magic roamed freely.\nIn this chaotic epoch, Lissandra and her sisters, Avarosa and Serylda, sought to conquer whatever they could. Lissandra tried to control the mortal world, only to be attacked by the claws of Volibear , rendering her sightless.\nDeprived of her sight, Lissandra walked in dreams instead. Using her magic, she established a connection with powerful extradimensional entities known as the Watchers . On behalf of herself and her sisters, she made a deal with them to prepare Runeterra for the impending arrival of the Void.\nIn exchange, Lissandra and her sisters would be granted near-immortality and the ability to withstand the worst of the numbing frost. Named Iceborn , they were promised to be spared until the very end. Lissandra herself became the Watchers' Seeker, mediating their will to the Iceborn.\nHowever, Avarosa and Serylda grew weary of their subservient role and sought to free themselves from their constraints. Caught in the middle, Lissandra tried to soothe her sisters' concerns while appealing to the Watchers for more time, but the Watchers became increasingly impatient. At some point, Avarosa and Serylda beseeched the demi-god Ornn to construct an expansive chasm and bridge , where they would then lock away the Watchers.\nThe sisters' conflicts had escalated into a full-scale war. As the war drew to an end, Avarosa and Serylda led their armies up into the mountains to face Lissandra. Despite Lissandra's efforts to remind them of the conquests achieved through their allegiance to the Watchers, her sisters remained indifferent.\nAt last, the Watchers had arrived in Runeterra. Drawing upon all ancient magic, Lissandra sacrificed her sisters and their amassed armies, before sealing the Watchers underneath a barrier of magical ice at the depths of the Howling Abyss.\nOver the passing years, Lissandra slowly realized that the barrier containing the Watchers was insufficient. The monstrous beings she had entombed were merely slumbering, gradually corrupting the True Ice around them into a more sinister essence. Now, they roamed through Lissandra's dreams as easily as she had theirs, and always she would wake, terrified, professing her loyalty to the chilling eternity they promised.\nLissandra rallied her remaining devotees to venerate her departed sisters. Their objective: accumulate as much True Ice as possible to prolong the delay of the Watchers' return, scouring the frozen expanses to enlist those of Iceborn lineage who would join their cause.\nLissandra and the first of her Frostguard exhausted all means to rewrite the history of the Freljord, erasing all records of the true events. Yet, whispers of rumors and prophetic tales endured in folklore and songs, foretelling the return of Avarosa and Serylda. Lissandra would kill silently anyone who had been claimed their reincarnations.\nIn one instance, Lissandra senses a Watcher trying to wake up. Laying down on the Howlling Abyss, naked, she uses her psychic powers to feed the Watcher dreams of others. She traverses the entire Freljord in astral form looking checking on other's dreams and even remarks on a young girl who appears to be iceborn.\nIn the final moments of the ritual, Lissandra enters the Watcher own dream, where she sees herself being devoured by them. She awakens horrified and spilling bile out of her mouth. But the Watcher is finally sleeping again. For her, this is a small price to pay for to keep them at bay.\nOn a night of frost moon, Lissandra walked through a sacred sanctum of hears, where she visited numerous ice coffins holding half-dead frozen people whom she uses to feed the Watchers. She visited their dreams as she passed between them.\nShe remarked two sisters who were frozen together and who were seemingly devoted to each other. She thought their devotion is foolish and mentioned she found it more convenient to lose her sisters.\nIn recent events, Lissandra commanded the story hunters to attack the Notai tribe, for they may harbor ancient history through their culture of retelling myths and legends. They found Nunu and other Notai children and took them to the Foundling Village . There, he met Lissandra personally, who asked him countless questions about his mother’s stories, always seeking information about one particular song.\nLissandra also told him about one fierce monster that killed all who sought its power, thwarting the Frostguard who were sent each year, never to return. Actually, she was trying to discover the location of the Svellsongur artifact .\nLissandra searches for a relic called the Heart of Blue, a weapon capable of creating pure ice, which she needs to keep the void at bay from Runeterra.\nLissandra is a towering blue pale-skinned woman with a semblance of a sculpture. She wears a gown that looks like is made of stone or ice. She wears her signature horned headpiece and is always being followed by a trail of Dark Ice . Her bluish silver hair is braided into a single pigtail that goes down to her waist. Without her helmet, Lissandra can be seen to have a majestic and expressionless face, with open eyelids showing her blind eyes.\nLissandra is a very imposing presence. She ports herself like a glorious monolith, always standing above everyone else. Lissandra is very manipulative, frigid, demanding, a perfectionist, and will do anything to achieve her goals. She is a very harsh leader and does not cope well with defeat or failure. She is also a very patient person, observing the Howling Abyss for almost ten millennia, waiting for the beings below to wake up.\nAlthough she has this icy facade, Lissandra is a fearful person. She is in constant dread that her past will catch up to her and perpetually carries a heavy burden. She came to accept that she will find no peace in this life.\nLissandra and her two sisters, Avarosa and Serylda, were three Iceborn sisters who served the Frozen Watchers until the latter two decided to fight for independence. Lissandra is the youngest of the triplets. [ 1 ] At the final battle on the Bridge above the Howling Abyss, she sacrificed her two sisters. After the fall of the Watchers and the deaths of her two sisters, Lissandra tried to wipe out any historical records of them from the Freljord. She was unable to completely snuff out legends regarding Avarosa and Serylda which still lingered on to the modern day. Seeing a threat in the tales about her past, Lissandra secretly plots the kill any potential Avarosa and Serylda figureheads.\nDeep down, Lissandra still loves her sisters and one of the main reasons she has to removed their names from history is because it hurts her to remember them.\nShe lost her sight to Volibear during one of their confrontations in the early days of the Freljord and along with her Frostguard has been actively containing his worship as well as other old demigods' in order to weaken them, though he refuses to vanish and continues to actively expand his influence.\nLegend says the Three Sisters asked for Ornn's help to build the Howling Abyss , though the tale may not be true.\nLissandra is actively trying to contain the worship of Anivia , sending out allied raiding parties to attack Notai carravans. At some point Anivia herself would battle against the Frostguard army.\nThe Watchers would give Lissandra and her sisters true Iceborn powers. Lissandra was the 'Seeker', the intermediary between the Iceborn and the Watchers. Eventually, after learning about the Watchers true intent, her sisters would openly rebel against them, with Lissandra seemingly still allied with them. During the final day of the rebellion, the Watchers broke out and threatened to consume the world, Lissandra betrayed the Watchers and sealed them away under the Howling Abyss . At that battle she sacrificed many, including both Avarosa and Serylda. Lissandra and her Frostguard keep watch over the Howling Abyss in an attempt to prevent the release of the Watchers .\nBefore becoming the Green Father, Ivern the Cruel was opposed to the Three Sisters.\nLissandra unleashed an icy cataclysm to seal the Watcher which also decimated the Yeti civilization and robbed the Yeti of their magic, resulting in most Yeti descending into savagery . The Frostguard keep some of the living savage Yetis as military animals.\nLissandra has found an easy ally in Trundle and the Frost Trolls . She would 1 freeze many Frost Trolls, eventually turning them into obedient 8 thralls .\nLissandra tried to kill Udyr and other spirit walkers when he was a boy.\nAshe and Sejuani are believed by Freljordians to be the reincarnations of Avarosa and Serylda, but are also possibly their direct descendants, making Lissandra their great-aunt-many-times-removed. Currently Lissandra is the leader of the Frostguard and openly hostile towards Ashe's and her Avarosan , and Sejuani and the Winter's Claw (as suggested by Legends of Runeterra official artworks, where Tryndamere is battling against the Frostguard forces, as well as the Frostguard openly raiding Avarosan settlements and attacking Braum when excaping Da'arvong in The Raid cinematic).\nDuring her attempt to find Avarosa's grave, Ashe and her original Avarosans were attacked by Lissandra's followers who were trying to conceal the truth. It is unknown what Ashe thinks of the Frostguard at the moment. Lissandra appears to know about Ashe faking the origin of her bow, as stated by one of their Legends of Runeterra interactions.\nShe met Nunu in the Foundling Village after his tribe was attacked by raiders. She told him about a beast that lived near by, which Nunu would later befriend and name Willump . Her intention was to gain a gem that swirled with the dreams of any mortal mind nearby that the Yeti Willump was keeping."}

Lulu shapes reality on a whim, warping the fabric of the world, and what she views as the constraints of this mundane, physical realm. While others might consider her magic at best unnatural, and at worst dangerous, she believes everyone could use a touch of enchantment.\nLulu, always a deeply empathetic and caring Yordle, once came across an injured bird and instinctively rushed to help. But as she reached for it, the bird transformed into a mischievous faerie . Laughing, it flew away, taking Lulu's staff with it, and she eagerly gave chase. As she pursued the faerie, the world around her began to shift and warp. Unbeknownst to Lulu, she had crossed into the spirit realm.\nThe faerie, who introduced himself as Pix , eventually stopped and, with a flick of his fingers, transformed Lulu’s simple walking stick into a magical staff. He led her to a place of ancient, pure primordial magic, where Lulu’s own powers amplified. He led her to the Glade .\nLulu in the Glade.\nBandle City , Lulu's home, was a strange and magical place that defied logic, where time was unstable, and the natural laws of the material world did not fully apply. Yet the Glade was an even stranger place - it had existed long before the Yordles came into the world, and perhaps it was from the Glade that Bandle City itself arose.\nHere, her imagination could manifest into reality, and she reveled in the freedom of creation. Lulu did not know whether Pix had brought her here because of a similarity of souls, or whether the Glade itself had called her, but she fell in love with this place instantly. She was so lost in the magic and wonder that she eventually forgot about existence of everything else. And time lost its meaning in The Glade - what seemed like mere days to Lulu could have been centuries or even millennia.\nYet one day, as if awakening from a long sleep, Lulu found herself back in the material realm, unsure of how long she had been gone. To her surprise and delight, she found that some of her newfound power had come with her, allowing her to make small things large, change colours to those more pleasing her, and make creatures spontaneously fall asleep. To Pix's infinite amusement, she turned the most powerful beasts into tiny, confused frogs or squirrels with a single swing of her staff.\nLulu travels across Runeterra using her magic freely, as evidenced by HUGIFIED squirrel.\nWhile she missed The Glade, Lulu set off on a journey across Runeterra , always searching for the elusive way back. Pix, however, claimed to have forgotten the way, but perhaps he did not wish to return yet. Together, they traveled from place to place, pulling playful pranks wherever they went. In lands of Demacia , known for their resistance to magic, she led a group of children away from their dull history lessons and transformed them into toadstools, to the horror of their parents and the local militia. The children eventually returned unharmed, but their wild stories were dismissed as fantasies.\nIn cold territories of Freljord , she found herself in the middle of a battle between rival tribes and decided to turn their weapons into flowers for her own amusement, creating chaos and confusion. More recently, Lulu has been seen wandering Ionia, playing among the glowing everblooms of Qaelin , and pranking the overly serious acolytes of the Shadow Order , who she thinks need to lighten up.\nThough Lulu longs to return to the Glade and often misses it, she finds joy in the present, where each day offers new adventures and excitement. Besides, she has come to understand that the Glade is always with her, carried in her heart wherever she goes.\nLulu and Tristana during their journey.\nDuring one of her adventures, Lulu travels with Tristana after visiting Poppy . As they step through a Yordle pathway, Lulu misplaces her Whispering Key, an ancient and powerful artifact she affectionately calls her \"Doodad.\" Ignoring Tristana’s growing concern about a nearby Noxian camp, Lulu eagerly uses her magic to track it down. Much to Tristana's dismay, the playful artifact begins to elude them, shifting into various forms whenever Lulu tries to catch a glimpse of it.\nBefore long, Draven and Tamara lead the Noxian forces in a sudden attack on the two Yordles. However, the land itself rises to aid them, as nature spirits joining the battle. While Tristana bravely holds off the Noxians, Lulu remains preoccupied with chasing her ever-elusive Doodad, laughing as it transforms into anything but its true form right before her eyes.\nIn the end, with the help of the spirits, the Yordles emerge victorious. Draven and the remaining Noxians are chased off by a massive, enchanted rabbit. Tristana gives a nod of thanks to the creature, while Lulu expresses her gratitude to the spirits and the land itself. With the battle behind them, the two friends continue on their way, ready for whatever the next adventure may bring.\nLulu wants to help in this mission.\nOne day, when Teemo was captured in Bilgewater by Graves , his Yordle friends in Bandle City decided to rescue him. Tristana, Timo's closest friend, insisted on going alone, but Lulu and Corky wanted to help too. Tristana convinced them to go on diversionary missions: she sent Corky after a made-up threat in Piltover and told Lulu to keep an eye on the stone.\nAfter the others left, Lulu became impatient and pouted, accidentally enlarging Pix's head. Meanwhile, Corky realized he had been tricked and returned to Bandle City, where he invited Lulu to cause some ruckus. By the time they regrouped, Tristana had also been captured. Corky attempted to fly his plane to rescue them, but crashed, landing in a cage.\nLulu, now larger than usual and still guarding the stone, approached them, complaining to Tristana that the stone was doing nothing. But when she touched the rune iron cage, she shrank back to her normal size, dropping the stone on Graves' foot and causing him to shoot a rope and accidentally free the other yordles.\nIn a last-ditch attempt to stop them, Graves grabbed Corky and threatened Tristana, but Lulu playfully and quickly turned Graves into a small Gromp. forcing Twisted Fate , who knew how this would end, to take his enchanted friend with him. With the danger over, Tristana thanked her friends for their support, and the Yordles returned to Bandle City.\nLulu is a Yordle with lilac-colored skin, and olive green eyes that have brighter tones closer to the iris. She has straight, long dark purple hair with some lash-grazing pieces in the front.\nShe wears a vermillion-colored pointy hat and robes with accents of gold. Her shoes are brown with a elf-styled toe tip.\nLulu had always been a caring and deeply empathetic Yordle, living in her whimsical dreams as if they were as real as the world around her. Her visit to the Glade, a realm of boundless primordial magic, only amplified these traits, transforming her perception of reality forever.\nNowadays, Lulu is an imaginative and carefree Yordle who lives in a constant state of wonder and playfulness, often blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. Her deep connection to the fae spirit Pix and her time spent in the Glade have made her both powerful and unpredictable. Lulu’s whimsical nature means she often acts without thinking of the consequences. Whether she’s turning enemies into harmless creatures or meddling in conflicts for her own amusement, Lulu sees it all as a fun game.\nDespite the chaos she causes, Lulu is kind-hearted and means no harm. Still, Lulu’s complete disregard for logic or caution means that her spells can create as much confusion as wonder, tipping the balance between delight and disaster for those around her.\nLulu is fiercely loyal to her friends, even if her antics often leave them bewildered. Beneath her playful exterior, however, lies a hidden vulnerability—despite her cheerful demeanor, Lulu fears deep down that other Yordles don’t truly understand or accept her, and that they may even despise her. It's possible, that this underlying fear of rejection, along with a profound loneliness, lingers beneath her whimsical surface, driving her to seek companionship through her playful escapades. [ 1 ]\nLulu likes both Poppy and Tristana , but she sometime finds them too serious for her liking.\nDraven and Tamara have encountered both Lulu and Tristana , fought and fled from them during his return trip from Basilich to Noxus Prime.\nGraves captured Teemo for the bounty on yordles while Twisted Fate refuses because \"messing with Yordles brings a whole heap of trouble.\" Corki , Lulu and Tristana fought Graves when trying to save Teemo, which ended up in Graves being turned into a frog and the Yordles escaping.\nIn the old lore, Lulu is a friend of Veigar . Their connection in the new lore is left unambiguous."}

Lulu shapes reality on a whim, warping the fabric of the world, and what she views as the constraints of this mundane, physical realm. While others might consider her magic at best unnatural, and at worst dangerous, she believes everyone could use a touch of enchantment.\nLulu, always a deeply empathetic and caring Yordle, once came across an injured bird and instinctively rushed to help. But as she reached for it, the bird transformed into a mischievous faerie . Laughing, it flew away, taking Lulu's staff with it, and she eagerly gave chase. As she pursued the faerie, the world around her began to shift and warp. Unbeknownst to Lulu, she had crossed into the spirit realm.\nThe faerie, who introduced himself as Pix , eventually stopped and, with a flick of his fingers, transformed Lulu’s simple walking stick into a magical staff. He led her to a place of ancient, pure primordial magic, where Lulu’s own powers amplified. He led her to the Glade .\nLulu in the Glade.\nBandle City , Lulu's home, was a strange and magical place that defied logic, where time was unstable, and the natural laws of the material world did not fully apply. Yet the Glade was an even stranger place - it had existed long before the Yordles came into the world, and perhaps it was from the Glade that Bandle City itself arose.\nHere, her imagination could manifest into reality, and she reveled in the freedom of creation. Lulu did not know whether Pix had brought her here because of a similarity of souls, or whether the Glade itself had called her, but she fell in love with this place instantly. She was so lost in the magic and wonder that she eventually forgot about existence of everything else. And time lost its meaning in The Glade - what seemed like mere days to Lulu could have been centuries or even millennia.\nYet one day, as if awakening from a long sleep, Lulu found herself back in the material realm, unsure of how long she had been gone. To her surprise and delight, she found that some of her newfound power had come with her, allowing her to make small things large, change colours to those more pleasing her, and make creatures spontaneously fall asleep. To Pix's infinite amusement, she turned the most powerful beasts into tiny, confused frogs or squirrels with a single swing of her staff.\nLulu travels across Runeterra using her magic freely, as evidenced by HUGIFIED squirrel.\nWhile she missed The Glade, Lulu set off on a journey across Runeterra , always searching for the elusive way back. Pix, however, claimed to have forgotten the way, but perhaps he did not wish to return yet. Together, they traveled from place to place, pulling playful pranks wherever they went. In lands of Demacia , known for their resistance to magic, she led a group of children away from their dull history lessons and transformed them into toadstools, to the horror of their parents and the local militia. The children eventually returned unharmed, but their wild stories were dismissed as fantasies.\nIn cold territories of Freljord , she found herself in the middle of a battle between rival tribes and decided to turn their weapons into flowers for her own amusement, creating chaos and confusion. More recently, Lulu has been seen wandering Ionia, playing among the glowing everblooms of Qaelin , and pranking the overly serious acolytes of the Shadow Order , who she thinks need to lighten up.\nThough Lulu longs to return to the Glade and often misses it, she finds joy in the present, where each day offers new adventures and excitement. Besides, she has come to understand that the Glade is always with her, carried in her heart wherever she goes.\nLulu and Tristana during their journey.\nDuring one of her adventures, Lulu travels with Tristana after visiting Poppy . As they step through a Yordle pathway, Lulu misplaces her Whispering Key, an ancient and powerful artifact she affectionately calls her \"Doodad.\" Ignoring Tristana’s growing concern about a nearby Noxian camp, Lulu eagerly uses her magic to track it down. Much to Tristana's dismay, the playful artifact begins to elude them, shifting into various forms whenever Lulu tries to catch a glimpse of it.\nBefore long, Draven and Tamara lead the Noxian forces in a sudden attack on the two Yordles. However, the land itself rises to aid them, as nature spirits joining the battle. While Tristana bravely holds off the Noxians, Lulu remains preoccupied with chasing her ever-elusive Doodad, laughing as it transforms into anything but its true form right before her eyes.\nIn the end, with the help of the spirits, the Yordles emerge victorious. Draven and the remaining Noxians are chased off by a massive, enchanted rabbit. Tristana gives a nod of thanks to the creature, while Lulu expresses her gratitude to the spirits and the land itself. With the battle behind them, the two friends continue on their way, ready for whatever the next adventure may bring.\nLulu wants to help in this mission.\nOne day, when Teemo was captured in Bilgewater by Graves , his Yordle friends in Bandle City decided to rescue him. Tristana, Timo's closest friend, insisted on going alone, but Lulu and Corky wanted to help too. Tristana convinced them to go on diversionary missions: she sent Corky after a made-up threat in Piltover and told Lulu to keep an eye on the stone.\nAfter the others left, Lulu became impatient and pouted, accidentally enlarging Pix's head. Meanwhile, Corky realized he had been tricked and returned to Bandle City, where he invited Lulu to cause some ruckus. By the time they regrouped, Tristana had also been captured. Corky attempted to fly his plane to rescue them, but crashed, landing in a cage.\nLulu, now larger than usual and still guarding the stone, approached them, complaining to Tristana that the stone was doing nothing. But when she touched the rune iron cage, she shrank back to her normal size, dropping the stone on Graves' foot and causing him to shoot a rope and accidentally free the other yordles.\nIn a last-ditch attempt to stop them, Graves grabbed Corky and threatened Tristana, but Lulu playfully and quickly turned Graves into a small Gromp. forcing Twisted Fate , who knew how this would end, to take his enchanted friend with him. With the danger over, Tristana thanked her friends for their support, and the Yordles returned to Bandle City.\nLulu is a Yordle with lilac-colored skin, and olive green eyes that have brighter tones closer to the iris. She has straight, long dark purple hair with some lash-grazing pieces in the front.\nShe wears a vermillion-colored pointy hat and robes with accents of gold. Her shoes are brown with a elf-styled toe tip.\nLulu had always been a caring and deeply empathetic Yordle, living in her whimsical dreams as if they were as real as the world around her. Her visit to the Glade, a realm of boundless primordial magic, only amplified these traits, transforming her perception of reality forever.\nNowadays, Lulu is an imaginative and carefree Yordle who lives in a constant state of wonder and playfulness, often blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. Her deep connection to the fae spirit Pix and her time spent in the Glade have made her both powerful and unpredictable. Lulu’s whimsical nature means she often acts without thinking of the consequences. Whether she’s turning enemies into harmless creatures or meddling in conflicts for her own amusement, Lulu sees it all as a fun game.\nDespite the chaos she causes, Lulu is kind-hearted and means no harm. Still, Lulu’s complete disregard for logic or caution means that her spells can create as much confusion as wonder, tipping the balance between delight and disaster for those around her.\nLulu is fiercely loyal to her friends, even if her antics often leave them bewildered. Beneath her playful exterior, however, lies a hidden vulnerability—despite her cheerful demeanor, Lulu fears deep down that other Yordles don’t truly understand or accept her, and that they may even despise her. It's possible, that this underlying fear of rejection, along with a profound loneliness, lingers beneath her whimsical surface, driving her to seek companionship through her playful escapades. [ 1 ]\nLulu likes both Poppy and Tristana , but she sometime finds them too serious for her liking.\nDraven and Tamara have encountered both Lulu and Tristana , fought and fled from them during his return trip from Basilich to Noxus Prime.\nGraves captured Teemo for the bounty on yordles while Twisted Fate refuses because \"messing with Yordles brings a whole heap of trouble.\" Corki , Lulu and Tristana fought Graves when trying to save Teemo, which ended up in Graves being turned into a frog and the Yordles escaping.\nIn the old lore, Lulu is a friend of Veigar . Their connection in the new lore is left unambiguous."}

Able to bend light to her will, she grew up dreading discovery and exile, and was forced to keep her power secret in order to preserve her family's noble status. Nonetheless, Lux's optimism and resilience have led her to embrace her unique talents, and she now seeks to bring greater tolerance and understanding to her homeland.\nLuxanna (Lux) was born in High Silvermere , a city in Demacia, into the Crownguard family, one of the richest and most powerful families in the kingdom. After her brother, Garen , joined the Demacian army, Lux was raised to be worthy of the Crownguard name, loyal and dedicated to the royal family. However, she rebelled against this pre-destined life, dreaming of exploring the world outside the walls of Demacia.\nOne night in her youth, Lux was riding home after one of these explorations, but was fallen upon by a pack of wolves hungry for her and her horse. As they were about to attack her, Lux, full of fear, unleashed a powerful blast of light from her hand. Horrified, Lux realized that she was a mage, the terror of the Demacians and her family. From that moment, she did everything she could to hide her powers for fear of what they would mean for her and for her family.\nFor the next few years, Lux tried to hide her magical powers, afraid of what would happen. Fearing that her power would cause her to become as evil as she had been taught mages were, or that her family would fall into disgrace, she spent sleepless nights trying to suppress her powers. She soon found, however, that she could not keep away. She began to familiarize herself with magic, practicing and experimenting in secret, bending the solar rays of the gardens into different solid forms or making sparkling lights dance between her fingers. Still afraid for what they might lead to, Lux decided to keep her powers a secret as long as possible.\nWhen she turned 16, Lux was taken to Demacia City by her parents to see Garen's ascension in the army. Here, Lux began to study the laws of Demacia, looking for a way that she and other magic people like her could live peacefully within the kingdom.\nLux stayed with Garen in Demacia City, and over time became a key asset in helping him maintain order in the city. One day, Garen chased a mage girl who was escaping, immobilizing and arresting her, reminding Lux of the fear she and other mages lived with in Demacia. Lux discovered that the woman carried a spell book, and after acquiring it she used it to practice her magic. Understanding the power contained within this magic book, and realizing the number of magic books that had been confiscated in Demacia's history, she decided to use her family's influence to enter the place where all those books were kept under lock and key to try and learn more about controlling her powers.\nFinding nothing useful in her search, she was returning home when she came across a doorway she did not know, guarded by two guards. The guards tried to bar her way, but upon hearing her family name she was granted access. Guided by one of the guards, she discovered that this was the place where the mages that had been captured were locked away. Realizing that this would be her fate should her powers be discovered, she felt the familiar feelings of fear and horror bubble within her, and walking around the place, she discovered that the mages were forced to drink a liquid which weakened their powers. When Lux asked why they didn't just exile them, the guard simply responded that sometimes exile wasn't enough of a punishment. As they walked, Lux saw a large door that caught her attention, but the guard told her that she could not enter because that was the cell of Sylas of Dregbourne , one of the most dangerous criminals in Demacia.\nAfter her powers were discovered, Lux was forced to flee Demacia, but not wanting to go with Sylas, she founded her own mage's refuge in which she would shelter mages who did not want to get involved in the civil war.\nLux is a tall, pale-skinned young woman with big blue eyes and shoulder-length golden blonde hair, on top of which she always wears a dark blue headband.\nWhile she generally wears typical demacian noble attire in public, she is primarily seen in armor with a silver-white breastplate and skirt, dark blue leggings covering her legs and arms, white heeled boots to match her skirt and breastplate.\nWhen Lux uses her magic, her eyes can sometimes change from blue to bright gold.\nLux presents an energetic and optimistic disposition, being happy and finding humor all the time. However, in more serious situations, Lux's facade drops and she turns out to be constrained and worried about her magic and being found out. She wishes for mages to be accepted in Demacia and opposes the Mageseekers' prosecution of them just because of their powers, sympathizing with Sylas for being unfairly imprisoned. When he betrayed her and started the rebellion, Lux saw him as the danger he truly was, though since the rebellion she has decided to help innocent mages secretly escape Demacia and join Sylas' camp, since being under his rule would be better than being trapped in a nation which saw them only as criminals.\nLux is the youngest in noble family Crownguard, born with magical abilities she keeps hidden for fear of being executed or exiled from Demacia . Lux feared of what could happen if her older brother Garen found out about her powers (their uncle was killed by a mage, an event that made Garen show magic users both zero tolerance and no mercy). She believed their mother was the only one who knew, however, she had no idea that Garen and their aunt Tianna had realized that she was a mage several years earlier, and were thinking of ways to protect her. Although they are aware of her power, they were somewhat in denial of Lux being a mage herself. After the events of the Lux comic , Lux got Garen to verbally acknowledge that she was a mage. The two parted ways on good terms.\nGaren and Luxanna's father, Pieter Crownguard, was a defender during the failed Noxian assault nicknamed Cyrus's Folly . This is likely referring to the same Cyrus who conquered the port city Basilich, which also happens to be the hometown of Darius and Draven .\nGalio deems Lux 'the only mage he likes' ( Link ▶️ \"You. Young girl person. Can you stay and accompany me wherever I go?\" ) and the one that can help him attain prolonged animation periods longer than a single battle. Lux was apparently the first person to have a conversation with Galio when she was 13-years-old, but he first became aware of her when her family made a pilgrimage to see him when she was a toddler. During the events of Warriors , Lux would make an appearance during Sylas' attack with the Winter's Claw on a northern fortress, which Garen and his soldiers had retreated to. When things were going badly for the Demacians, she openly reveals her magical power to call for Galio's help, which rallied Garen and his men.\nLux was introduced to the Illuminators by Kahina, Sona's adoptive sister.\nLux met Sylas when he's in prison. They developed certain bonds during their exchange, while Lux brought him food and books, Sylas taught her how to control her power. Later, Lux was manipulated and used by Sylas to escape Demacian imprisonment after he learnt about the property of petricite thanks to her. Sylas genuinely cares about Lux, but will not hesitate to harm her if she stops in his way. Lux, in turn, is also ready to stop him if necessary.\nLux was intended to marry Jarvan IV Lightshield as suggested by her brother Garen and her aunt Tianna , in order to gain political immunity that would protect her of any controversial accusations that would otherwise damage her and her family's reputation in Demacia.\nNocturne terrorized the Demacian settlement of Fossbarrow until Garen and Lux expelled him from the neighboring tomb. Nocturne was sealed in the grave of their great-grandfather Fossian, who died during the fight versus him, before a young mage named Luca accidentally woke him up."}

Although they are aware of her power, they were somewhat in denial of Lux being a mage herself. After the events of the Lux comic , Lux got Garen to verbally acknowledge that she was a mage. The two parted ways on good terms.\nGaren and Luxanna's father, Pieter Crownguard, was a defender during the failed Noxian assault nicknamed Cyrus's Folly . This is likely referring to the same Cyrus who conquered the port city Basilich, which also happens to be the hometown of Darius and Draven .\nGalio deems Lux 'the only mage he likes' ( Link ▶️ \"You. Young girl person. Can you stay and accompany me wherever I go?\" ) and the one that can help him attain prolonged animation periods longer than a single battle. Lux was apparently the first person to have a conversation with Galio when she was 13-years-old, but he first became aware of her when her family made a pilgrimage to see him when she was a toddler. During the events of Warriors , Lux would make an appearance during Sylas' attack with the Winter's Claw on a northern fortress, which Garen and his soldiers had retreated to. When things were going badly for the Demacians, she openly reveals her magical power to call for Galio's help, which rallied Garen and his men.\nLux was introduced to the Illuminators by Kahina, Sona's adoptive sister.\nLux met Sylas when he's in prison. They developed certain bonds during their exchange, while Lux brought him food and books, Sylas taught her how to control her power. Later, Lux was manipulated and used by Sylas to escape Demacian imprisonment after he learnt about the property of petricite thanks to her. Sylas genuinely cares about Lux, but will not hesitate to harm her if she stops in his way. Lux, in turn, is also ready to stop him if necessary.\nLux was intended to marry Jarvan IV Lightshield as suggested by her brother Garen and her aunt Tianna , in order to gain political immunity that would protect her of any controversial accusations that would otherwise damage her and her family's reputation in Demacia.\nNocturne terrorized the Demacian settlement of Fossbarrow until Garen and Lux expelled him from the neighboring tomb. Nocturne was sealed in the grave of their great-grandfather Fossian, who died during the fight versus him, before a young mage named Luca accidentally woke him up."}

In the desert wastes of Shurima , he opened his mind to the universe, and the whispers that answered led him to Icathia. Amidst the ruins of that land, he gazed into the dark heart of the Void itself—and Malzahar emerged changed, a shepherd empowered to bring others into the fold… or to release the voidling creatures that dwell beneath.\nBeneath the glare of the Shuriman sun, there have always been those blessed with the power of foresight. The only son of aging trinket peddlers, Malzahar did not realize his gift until his parents had already succumbed to a wasting sickness, leaving the young, traumatized boy to fend for himself on the city streets of Amakra . He read fortunes in the gutter, for a coin or scraps of bread.\nAs his auguries proved more and more accurate, his reputation grew.

It was apparent to him that people were bound up in a never-ending cycle of pain, often of their own making, and no hopeful prophecy seemed able to break it. Malzahar himself soon felt nothing but a sense of emptiness, finally relinquishing his mortal possessions and leaving Amakra for good.\nFor years, he roamed the land, from the trackless wastes of the lesser sai to the ruins of old Shurima. By distancing himself from others, he was alone with his thoughts at last. He divined not just how callous people could be, but also how corrupt the world might yet become. Feverish visions began to plague his waking hours, along with otherworldly whispers of war and strife, and endless suffering.\nHe wandered far, until the sands turned to salt. He could not know that he had arrived in Icathia , a lost city ravaged in the wars of a bygone age. There, gazing into the depths of a ragged abyss, Malzahar opened his unsteady mind, desperate for understanding.\nAnd the Void answered.\nThat would have been the end of any other tale, and yet somehow Malzahar endured.

Malzahar had seen in the abyss an end to all the suffering he had witnessed in his mortal lifetime. Malzahar was then whispered to by Bel'Veth , the Void Empress, who granted him a vision promising the destruction of Runeterra. He realized the future he had believed hidden from him all this time was in fact a vision of his true calling: to accelerate the world toward inevitable oblivion. Malzahar devoted himself completely to the Empress's will, his mind corrupted by the touch of a higher power. He had to return to the people, and spread word of the holy nothingness that would gladly embrace them, the willing and non-believers alike. He would become the herald of the world’s salvation.\nAmong the nomads of the deep desert, he found his first disciples. Before their astonished eyes, he used his new Void-given powers to rend the very earth itself, summoning chittering, nightmarish creatures to carry away any who dared to deny him. Within a matter of months, strange rumors began to travel with the merchant caravans; rumors of men and women gladly sacrificing themselves to unseen powers, and of powerful quakes opening up the bedrock of Shurima in new fault lines hundreds of miles long.\ngathering his followers, the Cult of the Void. Even since, rumors had been told of merchants killing themselves for their \"prophet\", earthquakes opening up large faults across Shurima, and settlers said to experience horrifying vision, sacrificing their cattle to satisfy the Void, Malzahar grows ever closer to bring about the apocalypse of Runeterra.\nIn the years since, Malzahar’s legend has spread even to the northern ports. As followers of “the Prophet” grow in number, nearby settlers are said to experience malefic visions grasping at their hearts, and fear gives rise to superstition—even the hardy villagers of the far wastes now make offerings of livestock to appease the voidling creatures below.\nMalzahar is a Shuriman man with dark skin and blue eyes. He dresses himself in desert clothes, with blue shirts and pants, and a magenta scarf and cowl covering most of his head. His most distinctive characteristic is the top of his head, that thanks to the power of the void, reveals a grotesque hole from where void energy pulses and flows.\nAs child, Malzahar lost his family and was forced to live alone, which gave him great sadness and also a sense of empathy towards others less fortunate. After becoming a famous fortune-teller, Malzahar took joy in helping others make choices about their futures and guiding their lives to a better path. In spite of this, he was still unhappy, as his experiences with others made him see more and more of human misery. This made Malzahar lose hope in humanity, which led to him come to Icathia and embrace the Void.\nAs The Prophet Of the Void, Malzahar is fanatically devoted to the powers of the Void, regularly sacrifing entire cities to the Void.\nEven though Malzahar (and Kassadin ) are both Shuriman their ties to the Void directs all their focus to the ancient city of Icathia and what lies within it.\nMalzahar might be attempting to make Icathia rise again just like Azir did with the Ancient Shuriman capital. It is uncertain whether or not he is aware of the rise of the Ascended . Even if so, making way for the Voidborn takes precedence over a handful of actually mortal demigods that can be overrun by infinite hordes anyway.\nMalzahar in turn lured Kog'Maw into Runeterra . It could be speculated the hivemind entity is the Mouth of the Abyss' 'Daddy', the 'Terror who is coming'. In short Kog'Maw might be foreshadowing a cataclysm on an interdimensional scale so large the Rune Wars will seem a children's brawl in comparison.\nBel'Veth is Malzahar's master, helping him in his goal to bring the Void to Runeterra in exchange for him providing her with sacrifices to assimilate."}

This made Malzahar lose hope in humanity, which led to him come to Icathia and embrace the Void.\nAs The Prophet Of the Void, Malzahar is fanatically devoted to the powers of the Void, regularly sacrifing entire cities to the Void.\nEven though Malzahar (and Kassadin ) are both Shuriman their ties to the Void directs all their focus to the ancient city of Icathia and what lies within it.\nMalzahar might be attempting to make Icathia rise again just like Azir did with the Ancient Shuriman capital. It is uncertain whether or not he is aware of the rise of the Ascended . Even if so, making way for the Voidborn takes precedence over a handful of actually mortal demigods that can be overrun by infinite hordes anyway.\nMalzahar in turn lured Kog'Maw into Runeterra . It could be speculated the hivemind entity is the Mouth of the Abyss' 'Daddy', the 'Terror who is coming'. In short Kog'Maw might be foreshadowing a cataclysm on an interdimensional scale so large the Rune Wars will seem a children's brawl in comparison.\nBel'Veth is Malzahar's master, helping him in his goal to bring the Void to Runeterra in exchange for him providing her with sacrifices to assimilate."}

She takes an interest in Jayce's experiments with magic.\nAs the daughter of Ambessa , a Noxian Warlord, Mel would learn about death and war from a young age. However, her advocacy of diplomacy and distaste for intimidating violence as a deterrent would later be deemed a liability by her mother. She was disowned and banished to Piltover , where Mel was to oversee Clan Medarda's business interests in the city. Despite being a Medarda, one of the richest clans in the city, she would be considered an outcast amongst her Noxian family members for not living up to their standards.\nWith dedication and political talents, Mel would succeed in rising up the political ranks of her clan, becoming a member of the Council of Clans and one of the richest people in Piltover. Nevertheless, her wealth and prestige paled in comparison to her Noxian brethren; thus she searched for an enterprise that could enhance the stature of Piltover and herself.\nDuring the trial of one Jayce Talis she would learn about the potential of magic being utilized with technology. This would intrigue her enough that she would vote for Jayce's expulsion from the Academy (as oppose to his banishment from Piltover), even convincing another councilor to vote in her favor.\nLater on, she would even help Jayce and Viktor with their attempt to sneak into Heimerdinger's lab, stipulating to them that they have one night to prove themselves and that their invention is workable. She then aids in concealing their activities by distracting a guard patrolling the Academy. After Heimerdinger arrives to thwart the two in conducting their experiment, he arrives too late and the two manages to prove they can harness magic via Hextech . Although Heimerdinger doesn't think Piltover should enable Hextech, Mel intercedes and proclaims that is an issue for the council to decide.\nWith her influence, the council votes towards the open implementation of Hextech, even funding the construction of the Hexgates.\nAs a Councillor, Mel was present during the 200th Piltovan Progress Day, where Jayce was to reveal his new Hextech inventions. Before Jayce's speech, Jayce had confided in Mel that Heimerdinger had advised him to delay unveiling his new hextech innovations until they can work out all the necessary safety measures, which could take a decade. Mel told Jayce that Heimerdinger is mired in the status quo; she encouraged Jayce to ignore his misgivings and proceed to unveil his new hextech at his presentation. However, Jayce faltered at the last minute, and decided to withhold his hextech innovations as Heimerdinger advised. Seeing Jayce delay his hextech revolution, Mel would leave the celebration early in disappointment. Before the end of the day, a Zaunite stole one of the hextech gemstones that was intended to be showcased during the speech event; in fear of the thief potentially weaponizing it, Jayce suggested to the Council that they shut down all Hextech operations, worrying the Councilors who have businesses dependent on the Hexgates. Seeing an opportunity, Mel then recommended that Jayce be instated as a Council member to better serve his goal of safeguarding the Hexgates and thus all matters dependent on it—a radical suggestion since the Council has traditionally only held seven seats. With Heimerdinger's agreement, the rest of the Council followed and Jayce became the eighth Councilor.\nMel became determined to mold Jayce into a leader that can overcome Piltover's reluctance to integrate new forms of hextech that will alter society. First, she guided Jayce to win over prominent Piltover citizens in order to garner enough support to defend his agenda in the political landscape, despite Jayce's reluctance to get involved in politics. This meant Mel had to introduce Jayce to the quid pro quo dynamics in politics—and surprisingly Jayce shown himself to be adept in enticing prominent merchants and politicians with exclusive, and sometimes unlawful, privileges in politics and commerce in exchange for their political and financial support. Mel was impressed by Jayce's fast adaptation to politics and together they consolidated their political power in Piltover. The two would bond over how they would intend to use their newfound influence to promote good and since they were enamored with one another, Mel expressed her romantic intentions for Jayce. Jayce reciprocated her feelings, and slept with each other that night, thus becoming lovers. After their night of passion, Mel woke up only to find Jayce had already left.\nLater in the evening, Mel began to paint an image of Noxus, which symbolized her secret aspiration to regain her Noxian honor. Jayce returned to her to apologize for his sudden disappearance, but Mel receives him coldly. He explains his disappearance was due to attending to Viktor, who has been hospitalized because he is dying. Mel softens and becomes sympathetic to his plight. Jayce confides in Mel about his frustrations; that he has been too distracted with politicking to accomplish any of the good he sought out to do, and now that Viktor is dying, he is helpless to save him. Mel also disclosed that she is an exile from her family because they thought she was unworthy. Jayce doesn't think that of Mel at all and encourages Mel to not give it any credence. Mel in turn comforts Jayce by telling him that although he may not be able to save Viktor, he should spend his remaining time with him so he doesn't feel alone in his final moments.\nIn the following days, Mel supported Jayce in some of his hardest decisions. When Jayce maneuvered to remove Heimerdinger from the Piltover Council for his continued obstruction of his and Viktor's hextech research (but blaming him for the problems of the Undercity as the public pretext), Mel backed his motion. Together, they rallied the Council and managed to oust Heimerdinger from his position. When Jayce had regrets about Heimerdinger, Mel justified his actions by stating everything he said about Heimerdinger was true; even if ousting him from the Council was harsh, it was necessary. This maintained Jayce's conviction. Tensions between Piltover and Zaun have also been heightened with all that has transpired. Mel passed on to Jayce that some in Piltover fear they are on the brink of war with the Undercity and that the Undercity could use the stolen hextech gemstone to attack Piltover. Mel advises Jayce to develop hextech weaponry in case he needs to defend his people. Although Jayce is conflicted about it and Viktor is vehemently against it, Mel leaves the decision up to Jayce.\nAs a reunion with her mother neared, Mel had a nightmare about a moment in her childhood where her mother tried to instill in her mind the ruthlessness that was expected of Noxians. She awoke distressed in her bed, reeling from the trauma from her childhood.\nDue to the increased violence from Zaun and the believed death of her brother Kino, her mother would arrive in Piltover to give her daughter what she deems proper guidance. Ambessa believes Piltover has allowed the threat of their Undercity to spiral out of control and advises that they need to quash the threat. However, Mel disagrees and rejects her advice.\nLater on, Vi and Caitlyn Kiramman revealed to the Piltover Council that a criminal mastermind named Silco is responsible for Piltover's and the Undercity's heightened problems, and also aims to have Zaun separate from Piltover as an independent nation. Jayce surprisingly became more militant and proposed that they wage war on Silco in force. Mel, who has experienced the brutality and costs of war, cautioned the Council to exhaust all diplomatic options and leave war as a last resort. The Council agreed with Mel, much to Jayce's disappointment. After the meeting, Mel angrily rebuked Ambessa for manipulating Jayce. Ambessa dismissed her anger and revealed the truth of her visit: the man who killed Kino is still a threat to the Medarda family and he's too powerful for Ambessa to fend off. Ambessa intends for the war between Piltover and Zaun to unfold so Jayce will be forced to develop hextech weapons, which Ambessa intends to appropriate and use against this powerful enemy. Ambessa offers to lift her exile if Mel aids her in her endeavor. However, after her discussion with her mother, Mel would deface her painting of Noxus, symbolizing her resolve to cut ties with her Noxian family.\nAfter Jayce led an unsanctioned raid on one of Silco's shimmer factories, he would learn the true cost of war and had a change of heart. This would ultimately lead to Jayce brokering a peace with Silco in exchange for Zaun's independence. Siding with Jayce, Mel would be the first councilor to agree to this proposal, spurring the rest to follow suit.\nWhile the meeting was almost done and the crisis nearly averted, Jinx attacked the council chambers; her Super Mega Death Rocket hitting the glass window right next to Mel. It is unclear if Mel survived that attack.\nIt is revealed that Mel did survive and she and Jayce were the only ones who came out unharmed from Jinx's attack while the other counselors were seriously injured or died from the impact of the explosion. Attends Cassandra Kiramman's funeral and comforts Caitlyn for her loss, she and the surviving councilors meet to decide how to respond against the Zaunites for the Jinx attack.\nMel then heads a debate on how to handle the situation with Zaun; as Salo argues under the influence of Ambessa to attack Zaun, Mel believes acting with impetus could immensely backfire. In her opinion, Mel believes that a sizable bounty should be placed on Jinx's head, but Shoola isn't keen on the idea. Salo then declares that Mel was outvoted two to one, but Mel regains the upper hand after agreeing to the invasion but rules against the use of Hextech.\nAfterward, Mel meets with a morose Jayce, who informs her of the comatose Viktor's condition inside the Hexcore. Trying to touch the Hexcore substance that Viktor was enveloped in, it nearly harms her, and Mel curiously asks what it's doing to him. Jayce answers that the Hexcore is evolving faster than what he can come up with. To his confession, Jayce laments that Viktor is in the state he's in and not himself. Mel consoles the agitated and remorseful Jayce and then details how the council meeting went, including how her mother's influential manipulation has hooked Salo on her goals. She assures Jayce that all will be well and suggests he meet with Caitlyn.\nBy dusk, Mel gives a speech to the people of Piltover centered around the loss of the three recently deceased council members and the plans for retaliations for those responsible. However, her speech is interrupted by a hoodlum disguised as an Enforcer and Renni who is in the audience and tries to kill Jayce. As enemy reinforcements arrive, Mel is escorted to safety by the Enforcer Steb .\nLater, Mel attends a private meeting with her fellow council members, who discuss how Renni and her cohorts managed to attack the place. They're soon joined by Caitlyn, who announces an endeavor to launch a counterstrike against Zaun.\nMel is an attractive slender, brown-skinned woman with green eyes. She has dark, curly hair with jeweled twists at her hairline. She wears elegant white clothing with gold accents reminiscent of both Shuriman and Targonian attire, mixed with common Piltover patterns.\nIn season 2, after being kidnapped by the Black Rose, she loses her gold hair cuffs and grows disheveled. Her makeup wears off, and her outfit grows dirty.\nWhen she awakens as a mage, she wears a black one-piece with smaller textured designs over the fabric. Her golden markings spread all over her body, including her face.\nHer body turns a purplish shade when using her full power, and her golden accents shine. Her eyes turn white, as does her hair.\nMel is a clever and cunning person, able to influence and manipulate people to her advantage. She cares for Piltover and wants to see it prosper, yet she is very calculated and analytical. While she cares for certain members of her family, she clashes with her mother and ultimately decides to vote for peace with Zaun in defiance of her mother's aggressive ideals.\nA brutal Noxian warlord, she taught her daughter about the art of war from a very young age while still being Solari. However, while Ambessa approved of Mel's cunning and statecraft, Ambessa was disappointed by Mel's lack of cutthroat instincts. One of Mel's most traumatic childhood memories is when Ambessa let Mel decide the fate of the last scion of a recently conquered regime. Mel advocated that they let the conquered scion live in exile in order to show their new subjects that they are merciful, but Ambessa argued that they should show no mercy to their enemies lest they rise up against them again. Ultimately, Ambessa personally executed the scion in front of Mel to teach Mel the lesson.\nEventually Ambessa would see that Mel's forgiving nature was a liability to her, so she banished her to Piltover. A strained relationship, Mel fears her mother while also resenting her for her past actions. She would eventually confront her about it, which would lead to Mel symbolically cutting ties with her Noxian roots.\nKino Medarda is the brother of Mel. Kino was said to be gifted with a silver tongue and also believed that he could talk his way out of anything. She is told that he eventually crossed the wrong man and died for it. He used to tell Mel that \"War was a failure of statecraft\", which may have influenced Mel's preference for diplomacy. Which indicates that Kino was one of the few members of his family for whom Mel had a lot of love and affection.\nMel respected Heimerdinger as the founder of Piltover. However, she saw his conservative and stifling ways to be a hindrance in her rise to power. She would undermine his authority by aiding Jayce and Viktor legalize the use of Hextech in Piltover, and later voting him out from the Council.\nWhile initially using Jayce to gain more wealth and prestige, Mel would eventually have some deeper feelings towards the inventor—even defending him from the self-serving influence of her ambitious mother. She would be concerned over his issues and would give him sound advice, all while still putting her own goals into consideration. Over time, Mel became less reserved around Jayce and began sharing personal details about herself as well. While Mel's relationship with Jayce started out as a means to an end, it ultimately became sincere love. Mel was crucial in Jayce's meteoric rise to fame: she even swayed the council to elevate Jayce and grant him a seat on the council.\nAs the assistant of one of Piltover's Council, Elora handled many of Mel's communications with her business and political associates.

She takes an interest in Jayce's experiments with magic.\nAs the daughter of Ambessa , a Noxian Warlord, Mel would learn about death and war from a young age. However, her advocacy of diplomacy and distaste for intimidating violence as a deterrent would later be deemed a liability by her mother. She was disowned and banished to Piltover , where Mel was to oversee Clan Medarda's business interests in the city. Despite being a Medarda, one of the richest clans in the city, she would be considered an outcast amongst her Noxian family members for not living up to their standards.\nWith dedication and political talents, Mel would succeed in rising up the political ranks of her clan, becoming a member of the Council of Clans and one of the richest people in Piltover. Nevertheless, her wealth and prestige paled in comparison to her Noxian brethren; thus she searched for an enterprise that could enhance the stature of Piltover and herself.\nDuring the trial of one Jayce Talis she would learn about the potential of magic being utilized with technology. This would intrigue her enough that she would vote for Jayce's expulsion from the Academy (as oppose to his banishment from Piltover), even convincing another councilor to vote in her favor.\nLater on, she would even help Jayce and Viktor with their attempt to sneak into Heimerdinger's lab, stipulating to them that they have one night to prove themselves and that their invention is workable. She then aids in concealing their activities by distracting a guard patrolling the Academy. After Heimerdinger arrives to thwart the two in conducting their experiment, he arrives too late and the two manages to prove they can harness magic via Hextech . Although Heimerdinger doesn't think Piltover should enable Hextech, Mel intercedes and proclaims that is an issue for the council to decide.\nWith her influence, the council votes towards the open implementation of Hextech, even funding the construction of the Hexgates.\nAs a Councillor, Mel was present during the 200th Piltovan Progress Day, where Jayce was to reveal his new Hextech inventions. Before Jayce's speech, Jayce had confided in Mel that Heimerdinger had advised him to delay unveiling his new hextech innovations until they can work out all the necessary safety measures, which could take a decade. Mel told Jayce that Heimerdinger is mired in the status quo; she encouraged Jayce to ignore his misgivings and proceed to unveil his new hextech at his presentation. However, Jayce faltered at the last minute, and decided to withhold his hextech innovations as Heimerdinger advised. Seeing Jayce delay his hextech revolution, Mel would leave the celebration early in disappointment. Before the end of the day, a Zaunite stole one of the hextech gemstones that was intended to be showcased during the speech event; in fear of the thief potentially weaponizing it, Jayce suggested to the Council that they shut down all Hextech operations, worrying the Councilors who have businesses dependent on the Hexgates. Seeing an opportunity, Mel then recommended that Jayce be instated as a Council member to better serve his goal of safeguarding the Hexgates and thus all matters dependent on it—a radical suggestion since the Council has traditionally only held seven seats. With Heimerdinger's agreement, the rest of the Council followed and Jayce became the eighth Councilor.\nMel became determined to mold Jayce into a leader that can overcome Piltover's reluctance to integrate new forms of hextech that will alter society. First, she guided Jayce to win over prominent Piltover citizens in order to garner enough support to defend his agenda in the political landscape, despite Jayce's reluctance to get involved in politics.

However, Luné was caught plotting treason against the Yun Tal and imprisoned while Lupé and her family faced punishment by proxy of Lupé being her twin. Exiled to the furthest reaches of Ixtal , Lupé and her family lived in a faraway village that would eventually become Milio's birthplace.\nAs Milio came of age, Lupé started to teach him how to master the elemental axiomata. Unlike the rest of the family, Milio showed great potential as a prodigy of elemental magic but struggled to understand the discipline that came with it. Disappointed, Lupé eventually gave up on Milio's teachings but he still trained his own abilities in private. Abandoning the rigid restrictions of the teachings of his grandmother, Milio eventually learned how to control fire, the only element Lupé avoided out of spite against her twin sister. However, Milio began to question the capabilities of the fire axiom and instead believed it had potential for more positive effects rather than destructive ones.\nOne night, Milio was chasing a group of fireflies when he noticed a village huntress who was left badly injured and unable to move. Milio rushed to help her by keeping her stable with his fire axiom, but it wasn't enough. Knowing that the healer would've been too far away to arrive on time, Milio tried as hard as he could to shape his powers into a force that could heal. Milio felt the huntress' inner flame , a feeling of warmth which he began to sense in the nature all around him. Focusing all of his concentration on that warm and cozy feeling, Milio manifested his fire magic into a small fire elemental which was able to heal the huntress' wounds.\nHaving discovered a new axiom which he named \"soothing flames,\" Milio went home to tell his family about what he had done and showed off his new ability to summon his signature fire elementals, dubbed \" fuemigos \". While his family celebrated, Lupé was astonished by Milio's success in mastering the fire axiom despite going against the traditional teachings and discovering an entirely new axiom. Seeing his potential to undo the burdens placed on the family by her sister Luné, Lupé dedicated herself to teaching her grandson how to master his newfound abilities, preparing him for a journey to Ixaocan in order to restore the family's honor. Though he was nervous to endure the long trip by himself, Milio was motivated purely by the love he had for his family. For his journey, he and Lupé fashioned a backpack to store his fuemigos which he dubbed his \"furnasita\" and got a new set of clothes made by his family members. At the age of 12, Milio left his village and began his journey to Ixaocan, travelling across Ixtal while sending letters to his family about his adventures.\nMilio travelled through the jungle when he noticed a young cougar who was injured. Wanting to help, Milio used his fuemigos to heal the cougar and the cat repaid him with affection. They both took a nap under a sun spot until they were found by Nidalee , the fearsome Kashdaji Queen as told in scary stories across Ixtal. The young cougar was revealed to be a pakaa and a member of her pack. While initially distrustful towards Milio for being a human, Nidalee began to warm up to him and allowed him travel with the pack for a short while, befriending Nidalee and her pack. Milio eventually left for a nearby village having a bonfire in order to continue his adventure, but hoped to see Nidalee again someday.\nAt the village, Milio found a lot of hurt people and, using his soothing fire powers, tried healing as many as he can. Unfortunately, Milio was unable to heal everyone and a few villagers were too injured to be saved. Luckily, Milio was able to make their final moments warm and comforting. Despite being able to save lots of people with his powers, Milio began to become discouraged due to the villagers he lost and continued his journey. Throughout his journey, Milio encountered many other sights while hopping around many villages on the pathway to Ixaocan. At one point, he encountered a lady made of plants who Milio heard rumors of in a nearby village as well as a giant moving rock . Eventually, a shapeshifting vastaya named Neeko smelled the scent of the pakaa on Milio and, becoming curious, attempted to play a prank on him by shapeshifting as Milio himself. Milio eventually befriended Neeko, learning about her tribe and language before continuing on his journey. Throughout his travels, Milio became a legend amongst the Ixtali as \"the boy with the soothing flames.\" [ 1 ]\nDrawing on Milio's last letter to his family, depicting his triumphant arrival in Ixaocan .\nFinally making it to Ixaocan, Milio explored the wondrous capital city of Ixtal, amazed by the many sights. However, Milio has begun to notice that people are staring at him; spying on him. Unbeknowst to him, stories about his adventures caught the intrigue of his grandaunt Luné, who has been incarcerated deep below the city all this time without his family's knowledge. Despite all this, Milio eagerly began his training so that he may one day face the Vidalion and hopefully restore the honor of his family.\nMilio is a prepubescent Ixtali boy with tan skin, amber eyes and curly black hair. He wears a red Ixtali poncho made by his family with shoulder guards. On his back, he wears his signature furnasita; a white cone-shaped knapsack with highlights made of green jewels. His furnasita holds a large fuemigo; a round fire elemental with ring-shaped eyes and a crest on its forehead.\nMilio is incredibly compassionate and caring for others, using his abilities to heal and soothe wounds and expresses deep remorse when he's unable to save people. He cares deeply for others and has been capable of befriending lots of people on his journey to Ixaocan. However, he cares the absolute most for his family; his driving force for his whole journey in the first place. Though he has been at odds with his grandmother Lupé at times, especially during his training, he wishes to fulfill her wishes and regain honor to his family even if he seems content with how his family is living currently. [ 2 ] Though a natural prodigy of elemental magic, he lacks the rigid discipline that Ixtali practitioners of magic typically have as he struggles to grasp the rules of his grandmother's training.\nMilio is very playful and kind when he speaks to others. He is very forward thinking and focused on his journey to one day best the Vidalion, speaking on how he wants to grow big and strong one day once he grows up and trains his magic enough. Because of his dedication and love for his family, he often mentions and talks about them a lot, especially his parents and his grandmother Lupé.\nMilio has a great bond with all of his family members, ranging from his parents to his siblings as well as his many cousins, all of whom he grew up with in his home village outside of Ixaocan. They celebrated his accomplishment after he discovered an entirely new axiom when healing the wounded huntress. They made him the clothes that he would wear on his journey and continuously praise and encourage him.\nMilio speaks about his family very often, speaking highly of them and describing his extremely close and friendly relationship with each of them. He has seemingly befriended almost every member of his family, all of whom act as his driving force and motivate him to continue his journey. During his travels, he exchanged letters with his family to keep in touch with them, inquiring with them about their lives while he was away and often stating how he misses them and wants to make them proud.\nLupé is Milio's grandmother and the one who initially tried training him in his elemental magic. Though she noticed his natural affinity for magic, Lupé actually stopped training Milio as he couldn't follow the traditional disciplines of the axiomata. Once Milio showed promise in the fire axiom, which she actively refused to teach him out of spite against her sister Luné, Lupé put her grudge aside and saw the potential in her grandson. Lupé helped prepare Milio for his journey to Ixaocan in order to showcase his natural abilities and restore honor to her family, creating his signature 'furnasita' and resuming his training.\nMilio very dearly loves his grandma, or 'omele,' and is strictly motivated in making her proud once he restores the family honor. He often mentions her on his travels, stating how proud she'd be to see him now. On top of that, he speaks very highly of his omele, describing her as very strong and similar in personality to Nidalee , the fearsome Kashdaji queen he met on his travels. [ 1 ] Lupé is almost entirely focused on Milio's potential to restore the family's honor at Ixaocan, perhaps even disregarding her own family's feelings about it.\nLuné was imprisoned beneath Ixaocan before Milio was born, meaning she never got to meet her grand-nephew in person. However, after he gained fame across Ixtal as the 'boy with the soothing flames', she caught word of the stories about him and recently found out he made it into Ixaocan after his long journey.\nMilio's fuemigos serve as his main companions, as they are literal manifestations of his fire magic come to life. He carries a large one within his furnasita and often deploys smaller ones to heal and soothe wounds with their warmth.\nMilio considers his fuemigos as his best friends and, despite their inability to verbally communicate, ventriloquizes the fuemigos with a higher-pitched voice to reinforce his own thoughts.\nMilio used to hear stories of Nidalee as a frightening creature to be feared named the Kashdaji queen, but met her in person during his journey to Ixaocan after he healed one of her pakaa. While initially distrustful towards him at first due to his human nature, Nidalee grew a fondness for the boy and allowed him to travel with her pack for a while to the next village. She calls Milio her 'fire bug' and considers him an honorary pakaa. Milio left the pack on friendly terms with Nidalee, noting that she appears as extremely harsh and fearsome on the outside but was capable of seeing the genuine softness underneath her tough exterior. [ 1 ]\nMilio encountered Zyra on his travels, having initially heard stories about her in a nearby village and thinking of them as nothing but scary stories to tell to children. Though he saw Zyra from a distance, he immediately noticed how dangerous her plants looked and knew not to greet her and endanger himself. However, he notes in his letter to his parents that, despite her frightening appearance, he wishes he could say hi and befriend her. [ 1 ]\nMilio encountered Malphite on his travels, initially noticing the large mountain in his way despite it being nowhere on the map. Milio investigated the strange appearance of a new mountain and discovered Malphite's face and saw him begin to move. He didn't directly greet Malphite however, despite seeing him as extremely friendly, as he didn't wanna risk being stepped on. [ 1 ]\nNeeko noticed Milio because of the scent of the pakaa on his clothes, as he traveled with Nidalee's pack temporarily before leaving. Because Neeko was very close with Nidalee, she wanted to investigate and shapeshifted into Milio as a prank, amusing the boy and sparking their friendship. As the two traveled for a bit, Neeko shared lots of details about her language as well as her tribe that she's slowly creating, offering a home to any people in the jungle without one.\nMilio considers Neeko a new best friend and notes that he wishes he could help her on her mission to create a new tribe but prioritizes traveling to Ixaocan to restore his family's honor instead, wishing her farewell.

As a child, she witnessed the reaver king Gangplank murder her family—an act she brutally avenged years later, blowing up his flagship while he was still aboard. Those who underestimate her will face a beguiling and unpredictable opponent... and, likely, a bullet or two in their guts.\nSarah Fortune was born to the famous weapons manufacturer Abigail Fortune (her father's name is unknown), and lived with her mother in Bilgewater. Her mother taught her to make weapons of all kinds, the most prominent being firearms. Little Sarah's life was quite happy and pleasant, until the well-known looter Gangplank went to her mother's business to demand that she create two powerful pistols, to which Abigail accepted and said that in a year she would have them made.\nAfter a year Gangplank returned but had no intention of paying Abigail.

She rejects laws and traditions she believes are unjust, and fights for truth from the shadows of Demacia —even as others seek to repress it—by casting shields and chains of dark fire. More than anything else, Morgana truly believes that even the banished and outcast may one day rise again.\nMorgana and her twin sister Kayle were born on Mount Targon during the height of the Rune Wars to Kilam and Mihira , the current Aspect of Justice. Due to Mihira ascending while pregnant, the sisters were born with a fraction of her celestial power. As the war raged on, Mihira's celestial power began to overshadow her personality and affections as she dedicated more and more of her time to her duties as an aspect. Fearing what Mihira was becoming, as well as the enemies drawn to her light, Kilam resolved to take their daughters to safety. He fled Targon with his children and they would sail to the land that would be known as Demacia .\nThe sisters grew to having distinct and clashing personalities. While Kayle was arguing about the settlement's rules, Morgana would empathize with the newly arrived refugees.\nOne day, Mihira's sword would fell from the sky and clash into two. From that moment, feathered wings bursted from the sister's backs and remained, confirming the celestial magic would still remain inside them. While Kayle embraced her new power, Morgana resented her gifts. One day, the settlement was attacked, and the sisters flew to aid the people of Zeffira . While Kayle was busy dealing with the frontline attack, Morgana learned of a hidden wave of enemies attacking the city and left the frontlines to aid the citizens. After the battle Kayle lost trust in her sister for leaving her on the battlefield. Since that day, they were hailed as the Winged Protectors.\nMorgana and Kayle at the gates of ancient Demacia.\nKayle and Morgana put on their armors and helmets, and stood against an army before the city walls. They easily destroyed the first wave. Sensing the danger approaching in the skies, the Winged Protectors took flight without hesitation and engaged in a deadly battle with Aatrox , who managed to possess a new host. Aatrox was too powerful to be defeated physically for the sisters. As the last stand, Morgana left her sword behind, and stood against Aatrox, binding him with her chains of dark flame. Taking Morgana's sword, Kayle empowered her wings and sword with celestial flames and burned the mortal body of him, sealing Aatrox within his own blade.\nWarriors flocked to Kayle's banner at Silvermere's Peak, where she founded a judicator order to enforce the law, and hunted down rebels and reavers with equal fervor. Kayle allowed Morgana to rehabilitate wrongdoers who appeared humble enough to admit their guilt. However, some people in the Judicator Order and especially Ronas, one of Kayle's ardent disciples, decided to arrest Morgana and her followers when Kayle was bringing justice upon a distant kingdom ruled by a cruel, unrighteous king. In an attempt to protect her followers, Morgana conjured magical chains of fire and bound him until he fell dead. His death led to an outbreak of riot in the settlement.\nMorgana and Kayle fighting in the sky above Demacia.\nWhen Kayle found out what happened, she became enraged and with her power she summoned divine fire to punish the sinners and Ronas' killer. Morgana flew up to meet her, the two dueled in the sky, knocking down columns where they passed and killing people without realizing it. It seemed that one of them was eventually going to win but Morgana faltered because she and Kayle heard their father's screams and stopped fighting. Their father was mortally wounded, Morgana hurled her sword at Kayle through tears, and plunged to the surface like a meteorite to cradle her father.\nShe took her dying father in her arms, and in a sea of tears, cursed her heavenly inheritance for the destruction around her. A moment later, Kayle landed too, and between sobs Morgana asked her if the purification of mortals by smiting included her father. Kayle kept silent, grabbed Morgana's sword and soared into the heavens without looking back, disappearing. Morgana, hurt, tried to tear off her wings because now they were a reminder of her pain, she tried everything to remove them but could not do it, so she decided to tie them with steel chains to walk in the world of mortals. Morgana was known since then as the Veiled Lady.\nOver time, Morgana's role as one of the Winged Protectors of Demacia would fade into obscurity, with few knowing that there were in fact two protectors. Instead, Morgana would become known as the Veiled Lady or the Veiled One, a deity that Demacian's would pray to in order ensure their loved ones passed safely into the afterlife. Morgana would walk the realm, embracing mortals and enacting justice when needed.\nOne day, a cleric and his pupil entered the woods to find the Veiled One, for the Pupil had erred. After listening to them, The Veiled One chained the sinful cleric for hitting the pupil in front of her eyes and forced him to endure all the shame, suffering, and loneliness he had inflicted on his pupils. On another day, she saved two girls from the men with swords, asking question about their village, and threatening them.\nShe currently resides in Sacred Woods outside of Demacia, waiting for the day she is needed again.\nFor centuries, Morgana has tried to find her sister, and written down her findings on her journal. A Solari warrior reported a sighting of a winged creature on the peaks of the mountain, ascending higher. A wind mage said that a bright flame streaked through the air, spinning away faster and faster. A Demacian noble was convinced that the Winged Protector was still alive, so he sent out rider to track her. After decades, the riders found a single white feather beneath Targon. A Lunari child, in the middle of the night, said that he saw a winged ghost, flying around the mountain. Yet, his mother did not believe him.\nMany centuries passed, Morgana heard a voice. A lonely, so distant prayer. She had no idea where it came from, but she was so sure that Kayle was praying to her. However, her prayers remained unanswered.\nMorgana welcoming Nilah in her sanctuary.\nNilah came to Morgana, bruised and bleeding after the battle with Volibear . Morgana welcomed Nilah and her crew in her sanctuary, offering them healing for their wounds and much needed breathing place. The crew confided in the Veiled One, and shared their stories and missions. However, their meeting was interrupted all of a sudden.\nOutcast and imprisoned mages -who escaped the ship of Mageseekers-, and the followers of the Veiled Lady were under persecution by the Mageseekers. They were trying to reach the sanctuary, yet one of them got caught. 4 Klaus, the Mageseeker Inquisitor ordered his fellows to take 2 Ruby-Eyed Conjurer and the others back to the ship, and then up Mount Targon after the rest of them.\nMorgana did not waste any time to come to their rescue, and bound the oppressors with her shackles to feel the weight of their sins. Morgana saved and led them to her sanctuary. The 5 Veiled Protector ensured that sanctuary seekers on the slopes of Mount Targon completed the journey unscathed, whereas the protector was hit by a number of arrows. Morgana might have saved 3 Lisa , one of the outcast mages who lost her family, and she’s raising her now.\nWhen the rebellion of the mages of Demacia broke out, Sylas , one of the most powerful mages of the rebellion , decided to go into Sacred Woods to find the Veiled Lady in search of power and knowledge for his cause. She told him that he should fight with her as a test to have the knowledge. After the fight, Morgana refused to give Sylas the information he was looking for, because she saw that in his heart there was only vengeance and hatred.\nAs Sylas makes his way to the Veiled Lady's refuge, he reflects on how he failed to save Leilani. When he reaches Morgana, Sylas finally understands why he failed her test, his rage and vengeance alone isn't enough to win them this war. Seeing him humbled by his failures, Morgana, satisfied and ready to give Sylas her blessing, shows him the true origin of Demacia.\nSylas realizes Morgana was one of the Winged Protectors, alongside her sister Kayle. When he asks why she doesn't reveal herself, Morgana replies that if she returned, so would her sister, and Demacia isn't ready for her judgment. She then presents him with one of her sister's feathers and uses it grant him her blessing, the ability to show the vision of Demacia's foundation.\nNow, the people of Demacia know that there were two Winged Protectors during the foundation of the nation, since Sylas showed the vision to the common folk.\nMorgana is a  slim and curvy young woman with dull pale skin, dark purple short hair with a bang on the left side, bright violet eyes with makeup runnings, pointy ears, dark purple lipstick and four wings on her waist and two wings on her nape that vary in black and purple colors. She was ascended on her thirties, so her aging has stopped since then.\nHer attire consists of a long dress that matches the color of her wings, revealing her arms and neckline, leaving her back uncovered, and with various chain ornaments behind her wings and hips.\nContradicting everything they think of her, Morgana is not the \"evil twin\"; she is just an incarnation of the other side of justice, while her sister Kayle represents blind justice, Morgana represents compassionate justice that consists of listening to reasons first for the sinners' actions before deciding whether or not to punish them. Indicating that Morgana is fair and compassionate towards people.\nAt first she rejected her celestial powers and that caused them to become corrupted, but she sees them as a perfect weapon to punish in a fair and compassionate way, so as not to forget her humanity and her emotions. Since she could not cut her wings, she tied them. Having her wings tied together symbolizes that she still has humanity inside her and although Kayle is her rival, deep down she still loves her and wishes that one day they can be together again as sisters and not as enemies.\nBoth Morgana and Kayle are twin siblings, Kayle being the older of the two. Their relationship soured after the event that lead to the death of their father. Morgana chooses not to return to Demacia because she knows her sister would return as well. [ 1 ]\nMihira is Morgana's mother. It is implied that Morgana does not love her mother, blaming her for causing her father pain and distress after becoming an Aspect. However deep down she still loves her and misses her but refuses to acknowledge it partly because of her pride.\nAatrox and Morgana fought approximately a millenia ago. At the end of the battle, Aatrox was sealed within his blade.\nNilah and Morgana met in the not-so-distant past. Whereas Morgana felt Nilah's pain, she found strange her everlasting jubilance.\nSylas knows certain truths about the sisters and calls out their power during the events of Lux comics . Morgana aided Sylas in defeating the Mageseekers by revealing her true identity and giving him her blessing."}

She rejects laws and traditions she believes are unjust, and fights for truth from the shadows of Demacia —even as others seek to repress it—by casting shields and chains of dark fire. More than anything else, Morgana truly believes that even the banished and outcast may one day rise again.\nMorgana and her twin sister Kayle were born on Mount Targon during the height of the Rune Wars to Kilam and Mihira , the current Aspect of Justice. Due to Mihira ascending while pregnant, the sisters were born with a fraction of her celestial power. As the war raged on, Mihira's celestial power began to overshadow her personality and affections as she dedicated more and more of her time to her duties as an aspect. Fearing what Mihira was becoming, as well as the enemies drawn to her light, Kilam resolved to take their daughters to safety. He fled Targon with his children and they would sail to the land that would be known as Demacia .\nThe sisters grew to having distinct and clashing personalities. While Kayle was arguing about the settlement's rules, Morgana would empathize with the newly arrived refugees.\nOne day, Mihira's sword would fell from the sky and clash into two. From that moment, feathered wings bursted from the sister's backs and remained, confirming the celestial magic would still remain inside them. While Kayle embraced her new power, Morgana resented her gifts. One day, the settlement was attacked, and the sisters flew to aid the people of Zeffira . While Kayle was busy dealing with the frontline attack, Morgana learned of a hidden wave of enemies attacking the city and left the frontlines to aid the citizens. After the battle Kayle lost trust in her sister for leaving her on the battlefield. Since that day, they were hailed as the Winged Protectors.\nMorgana and Kayle at the gates of ancient Demacia.\nKayle and Morgana put on their armors and helmets, and stood against an army before the city walls. They easily destroyed the first wave. Sensing the danger approaching in the skies, the Winged Protectors took flight without hesitation and engaged in a deadly battle with Aatrox , who managed to possess a new host. Aatrox was too powerful to be defeated physically for the sisters. As the last stand, Morgana left her sword behind, and stood against Aatrox, binding him with her chains of dark flame. Taking Morgana's sword, Kayle empowered her wings and sword with celestial flames and burned the mortal body of him, sealing Aatrox within his own blade.\nWarriors flocked to Kayle's banner at Silvermere's Peak, where she founded a judicator order to enforce the law, and hunted down rebels and reavers with equal fervor.

It is the call of the dune hounds, voracious predators who form packs and compete for the right to hunt in these barren lands. Among them, one pack stands above all, for they are driven not only by canine instincts, but by the ancient power of the Darkin .\nNaafiri began as one of the many Ascended God-Warriors of Shurima , having achieved Ascension at an unknown point in the past. As a part of the Ascended Host, Naafiri fought alongside her fellow God-Warriors when the city-state of Icathia began their uprising . During this war, she witnessed the horrors of the Void as the Icathians attempted to weaponize it, scarring her mind. [ 1 ]\nAfter the Shuriman Empire fell due to the sudden and disastrous death of the emperor Azir , the many Ascended renamed themselves Sunborn and violently clashed with one another due to the lack of leadership and purpose. Their battle brought so much devastation that the mortals eventually began to call these Sunborn Darkin , an old Shuriman word which most closely translated to The Fallen .\nDuring the Great Darkin War , Naafiri was considered one of the more powerful among them and sought out to lead the rest of her kind. Her pride and vanity got the best of her when she was easily tricked by Myisha, the Aspect of Twilight , who imprisoned Naafiri inside one of her steel throwing daggers.\nWhile imprisoned within a dagger, Naafiri was hidden within a Shuriman crypt and left unable to move or speak due to her newfound curse. Inert and left to dwell on her shame and regret, Naafiri suddenly felt an eager anticipation when she sensed a human presence nearby. She intended to posess the body of this grave robber, but the man was well aware of Naafiri's magic and made careful efforts not to make contact with the blade. Using tongs to pick it up, he wrapped Naafiri in a thick, lead-lined cloth and rode off across the desert that afternoon.\nNaafiri despaired over her thwarted plan to escape her confinment, but saw an opportunity when she sensed the howls of a pack of Shuriman dune hounds across the desert. She called out to the beasts, hoping they would be driven to the grave robber and allow her to possess his body. The man made efforts not to touch the dagger, holding it through the thick fabric of the lead cloth, but was ultimately ravaged by the ravenous hounds as they tore him and his horse apart. In that moment, the hounds attempted to devour Naafiri and, upon contact, Naafiri felt the sudden rush of senses return to her as she completely possessed the entire pack of dune hounds, shattering her consciousness across all of them.\nInitially, Naafiri resented her new form and cursed the beasts that encompassed it. She considered the hounds as nothing but feral animals and despised their smell, fleas and their need for companionship among each other. Over time, Naafiri felt a sense of enlightenment as she realized the true strength and wisdom that comes with being a collective. Apart, the hounds would quickly starve to death, but together they could easily become apex predators.\nWith newfound wisdom thanks to her new form, Naafiri realizes that the concept of a collective overpowering all living things was not limited to just her dune hounds, but could easily be applied to the likes of the Darkin as well. Realizing that the Darkin ultimately fell due to their petty, personal grudges with one another, Naafiri wishes to locate her fellow Darkin siblings and restore their place as the rightful and violent rulers of Runeterra.\nNow, Naafiri stalks the Shuriman deserts in hopes of unifying the rest of her Darkin and becoming the ultimate apex predator. Her pack acts with perfect unity and stalk the pitch black Shuriman nights, ravenously feasting on anyone they find as she continues her quest.\nNaafiri's \"primary\" body is that of a monstrous, vicious-looking dog with numerous large, blade-like spikes protruding from her shoulders. Like other Darkin, she appears to have tough, ridged, armor-like skin: primarily black with red accents and an area of white around her lower face. She has bright yellow eyes. Naafiri's most prominent facial feature is the infused dagger. The dagger also has a golden spike ornament dangling from a chain, and she is shown to wear it as an earring on her left ear.\nHer packmates are slightly smaller dogs with a simpler color scheme: solid red with areas of black on their tails and the tops of their heads. They also only have one blade-like spike protruding from their heads.\nNaafiri wants the Darkin to become the dominant lifeform on Runeterra again.

It is the call of the dune hounds, voracious predators who form packs and compete for the right to hunt in these barren lands. Among them, one pack stands above all, for they are driven not only by canine instincts, but by the ancient power of the Darkin .\nNaafiri began as one of the many Ascended God-Warriors of Shurima , having achieved Ascension at an unknown point in the past. As a part of the Ascended Host, Naafiri fought alongside her fellow God-Warriors when the city-state of Icathia began their uprising . During this war, she witnessed the horrors of the Void as the Icathians attempted to weaponize it, scarring her mind. [ 1 ]\nAfter the Shuriman Empire fell due to the sudden and disastrous death of the emperor Azir , the many Ascended renamed themselves Sunborn and violently clashed with one another due to the lack of leadership and purpose. Their battle brought so much devastation that the mortals eventually began to call these Sunborn Darkin , an old Shuriman word which most closely translated to The Fallen .\nDuring the Great Darkin War , Naafiri was considered one of the more powerful among them and sought out to lead the rest of her kind. Her pride and vanity got the best of her when she was easily tricked by Myisha, the Aspect of Twilight , who imprisoned Naafiri inside one of her steel throwing daggers.\nWhile imprisoned within a dagger, Naafiri was hidden within a Shuriman crypt and left unable to move or speak due to her newfound curse. Inert and left to dwell on her shame and regret, Naafiri suddenly felt an eager anticipation when she sensed a human presence nearby. She intended to posess the body of this grave robber, but the man was well aware of Naafiri's magic and made careful efforts not to make contact with the blade. Using tongs to pick it up, he wrapped Naafiri in a thick, lead-lined cloth and rode off across the desert that afternoon.\nNaafiri despaired over her thwarted plan to escape her confinment, but saw an opportunity when she sensed the howls of a pack of Shuriman dune hounds across the desert. She called out to the beasts, hoping they would be driven to the grave robber and allow her to possess his body. The man made efforts not to touch the dagger, holding it through the thick fabric of the lead cloth, but was ultimately ravaged by the ravenous hounds as they tore him and his horse apart. In that moment, the hounds attempted to devour Naafiri and, upon contact, Naafiri felt the sudden rush of senses return to her as she completely possessed the entire pack of dune hounds, shattering her consciousness across all of them.\nInitially, Naafiri resented her new form and cursed the beasts that encompassed it. She considered the hounds as nothing but feral animals and despised their smell, fleas and their need for companionship among each other. Over time, Naafiri felt a sense of enlightenment as she realized the true strength and wisdom that comes with being a collective. Apart, the hounds would quickly starve to death, but together they could easily become apex predators.\nWith newfound wisdom thanks to her new form, Naafiri realizes that the concept of a collective overpowering all living things was not limited to just her dune hounds, but could easily be applied to the likes of the Darkin as well. Realizing that the Darkin ultimately fell due to their petty, personal grudges with one another, Naafiri wishes to locate her fellow Darkin siblings and restore their place as the rightful and violent rulers of Runeterra.\nNow, Naafiri stalks the Shuriman deserts in hopes of unifying the rest of her Darkin and becoming the ultimate apex predator. Her pack acts with perfect unity and stalk the pitch black Shuriman nights, ravenously feasting on anyone they find as she continues her quest.\nNaafiri's \"primary\" body is that of a monstrous, vicious-looking dog with numerous large, blade-like spikes protruding from her shoulders. Like other Darkin, she appears to have tough, ridged, armor-like skin: primarily black with red accents and an area of white around her lower face. She has bright yellow eyes. Naafiri's most prominent facial feature is the infused dagger. The dagger also has a golden spike ornament dangling from a chain, and she is shown to wear it as an earring on her left ear.\nHer packmates are slightly smaller dogs with a simpler color scheme: solid red with areas of black on their tails and the tops of their heads. They also only have one blade-like spike protruding from their heads.\nNaafiri wants the Darkin to become the dominant lifeform on Runeterra again. As a means to power, she has abandoned her idea of self, allowing her consciousness to inhabit multiple bodies. [ 2 ] Due in part to her canine hosts, she is vicious and bloodthirsty, with a bestial instinct to hunt and kill.\nDuring the Darkin War, Naafiri fought against her fellow Darkin with the intent to become their leader.

The Marai would give this pearl to a group of humans in exchange for a moonstone, a glowing rock that would ward off dangerous creatures from the deep sea. A Tidecaller is titled and sent on their quest whenever the moonstone's light starts to dim. The deep sea is wrought with dangerous creatures, so the warrior titled a Tidecaller must be strong enough to survive them and find the pearl.\nDuring Nami's adolescence, the moonstone in the center of the Marai's village began to dim. Nami attempted the trial of the Tidecaller, but she was denied due to her impulsiveness. Instead, another warrior named Rasho was sent down into the deep sea to retrieve the pearl. But after a month, Rasho had not returned. Determined to prove herself and save her people, Nami took her mother's staff and plunged into the depths.\nAfter several days, Nami returned with the pearl and Rasho's staff. She was designated Tidecaller by her people and she went to the surface to trade with the humans for the moonstone. However, when she arrived to the surface, a woman told Nami that the Aspect of the Moon , the person that made the moonstones, had fled Targon and as such they could not give them the stone.

Nasus was forced to imprison his own brother with the betrayer Xerath , who would later drive Renekton into madness.

Nasus was a warrior scholar who spearheaded the military and cultural uprising of Ancient Shurima, but Azir's misled arrogance led to the empire's downfall, costing him his own brother Renekton .

No one is ever sure where—or who—Neeko might be, but those who intend to do her harm will soon witness her true colors revealed, and feel the full power of her primordial spirit magic unleashed upon them.\nNeeko is a vastaya born in the Oovi-Kat tribe, who lived on a remote island far to the east of Valoran . The Oovi-Kat retained most of their ancient heritage, tracing their lineage back to the vastayashai'rei —the ancestors of all vastaya. The Oovi-Kat lived in a peaceful and harmonious paradise that blended into the spirit realm . Because of this, the Oovi-Kat had a talent in sensing the Sho'ma , or 'soul' of living beings, creating a society free of secrets. Neeko grew up in this tribe with a fondness for games and trinkets, growing a sense of innocence and curiosity for all things.\nWhen an undisclosed cataclysm devastated the Oovi-Kat, the elders of the tribe sacrificed themselves to allow some of the remaining vastaya to escape with their lives. Neeko, being among them, took the form of a bird and fled the smoldering destruction as her home faded into the border between realms.\nDays later, Neeko became exhausted and clung to a plank of driftwood in the Eternal Ocean . She eventually came across a mercantile vessel travelling for Harelport and crept aboard, resting where she could and calling into the spirit realm for her tribe. The only response she could get were scattered echoes and images of dead trees laying over the horizon.\nWhen the vessel arrived in the city, Neeko emerged in an unfamiliar world bustling with unique personalities and shapes that were completely alien to her. Neeko became entranced with curiosity and wandered with awe, eventually being spotted by a vastayan sailor named Krete. He demanded to know what tribe she was a member of and, in response, Neeko reached into his Sho'ma and mimicked his appearance; an expression of friendliness and peace in Oovi-Kat culture. Krete became offended and frightened by Neeko's shapeshifting and, overwhelmed by his thoughts, Neeko fled into the crowd.\nNeeko eventually traveled out of Harelport and into the lush jungles of Ixtal . Seeking solace, she spotted a pack of pakaa from the trees; fierce and majestic jungle cats native to the forests. By taking their form, Neeko ran with them across the jungles. While enjoying this cougar-like form she took, the leader of this pack unexpectedly shapeshifted into a seemingly human woman named Nidalee . After a tense standoff, Nidalee reluctantly accepted Neeko into her pack.\nLiving within the pack, Neeko and Nidalee became inseparable as some sort of relationship blossomed between them, feeling a deep sense of kinship for Nidalee. For months, Nidalee enjoyed mentoring Neeko in the art of survival within the jungles and the two enjoyed wandering the wilds together. [ 1 ] Though Neeko began to feel intense romantic feelings for her new friend, these feelings went mostly unrequited, though still blossoming with lots of potential.\nThough Nidalee despised the towns and cities of the civilized people, Neeko constantly felt an urge to curiously explore them and she longed to explore more of the world outside of the jungles. One night, Neeko's Oovi-Kat ancestors came to her in a dream, showing her the pale branches of dead trees and acting as an omen of warning to Neeko of the danger her people are in. With this, Neeko vowed to recreate the Oovi-Kat as an entirely new tribe of her own, wishing to venture out to pursue this personal journey. Though she urged Nidalee to join her, she could not be persuaded and the two parted ways to follow their own quests.\nNeeko continued her journey to rebuild the Oovi-Kat in her own way, welcoming all beings whether they be like-hearted vastaya, yordles , humans and other creatures. Those that join her tribe are easily befriended by Neeko, who in turn vows to defend their sho'ma with her own life.\nWhile travelling, Neeko found herself at a Noxian Outpost at Kalduga . Curious to see if the Noxians were friendly, she snuck into the outpost and took the form of Ewaii, one of the patrolling soldiers at the outpost. While disguised, Ewaii's commander Yubbers began to yell commands at Neeko under the impression that she was in fact Ewaii.\nNeeko then took a mote of Yubber's sho'ma, shifting her shape into his and confusing the soldiers even more. Eventually, Neeko got caught by the actual Yubbers and disappeared into a crowd of people while changing her shape. Mayhem ensued as the guards began to accuse one another and kill each other out of fear as Neeko snuck away. The soldiers abandoned the outpost completely, each going their separate ways and uncertainty of who was secretly Neeko all along. [ 2 ]\nAt some point, Neeko got captured by a band of Piltovan poachers led by 7 Captain Rowain . These poachers sought to catch and eventually sell exotic creatures of the jungles in hopes of making a large profit. A scientist who had been hired by the poachers named 3 Anura , alongside her pet frog Froop, felt sympathy for the captured vastaya and devised a massive escape plan to free her. [ 3 ]\nSuccessfully freed from her capture by the poachers, Neeko found herself back in the jungles and reunited with her old friend Nidalee. Neeko warned Nidalee of the poachers and the two planned to drive them out of the jungle. Under the cover of night, Nidalee and Neeko ambushed the poachers' encampment alongside the rest of the pakaa pack and some 6 other wildlife , driving them out of the forests. [ 4 ]\nNeeko is a female vastaya that has a teen-like appearance and some characteristics of a chameleon, like scales and reptile eyes. She has very colorful hair with glands sprouting out of her head which she uses to capture others' Sho'ma. She wears tribal clothes and walks barefoot.\nNeeko has a very jovial and fun-going personality. She is somewhat innocent and unaware the dangers that surround her. She does not comprehend most of human society and relationships, and some of the words, so she usually creates chaotic scenarios thanks to her naivety.\nNeeko has spent some time with Nidalee and her pack. Though Nidalee wouldn't aid her in her further quests, they parted on relatively positive terms. Neeko is in love with Nidalee, and while the romantic feelings were unreturned, their interpersonal relationship is beginning to blossom. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The two care for each other deeply and Neeko is perhaps the only person outside of her family whom Nidalee would risk her life for.\nNeeko mimicked Ezreal in the jungle during his search for The Elixir of Uloa ."}

No one is ever sure where—or who—Neeko might be, but those who intend to do her harm will soon witness her true colors revealed, and feel the full power of her primordial spirit magic unleashed upon them.\nNeeko is a vastaya born in the Oovi-Kat tribe, who lived on a remote island far to the east of Valoran . The Oovi-Kat retained most of their ancient heritage, tracing their lineage back to the vastayashai'rei —the ancestors of all vastaya. The Oovi-Kat lived in a peaceful and harmonious paradise that blended into the spirit realm . Because of this, the Oovi-Kat had a talent in sensing the Sho'ma , or 'soul' of living beings, creating a society free of secrets. Neeko grew up in this tribe with a fondness for games and trinkets, growing a sense of innocence and curiosity for all things.\nWhen an undisclosed cataclysm devastated the Oovi-Kat, the elders of the tribe sacrificed themselves to allow some of the remaining vastaya to escape with their lives. Neeko, being among them, took the form of a bird and fled the smoldering destruction as her home faded into the border between realms.\nDays later, Neeko became exhausted and clung to a plank of driftwood in the Eternal Ocean . She eventually came across a mercantile vessel travelling for Harelport and crept aboard, resting where she could and calling into the spirit realm for her tribe. The only response she could get were scattered echoes and images of dead trees laying over the horizon.\nWhen the vessel arrived in the city, Neeko emerged in an unfamiliar world bustling with unique personalities and shapes that were completely alien to her. Neeko became entranced with curiosity and wandered with awe, eventually being spotted by a vastayan sailor named Krete. He demanded to know what tribe she was a member of and, in response, Neeko reached into his Sho'ma and mimicked his appearance; an expression of friendliness and peace in Oovi-Kat culture. Krete became offended and frightened by Neeko's shapeshifting and, overwhelmed by his thoughts, Neeko fled into the crowd.\nNeeko eventually traveled out of Harelport and into the lush jungles of Ixtal . Seeking solace, she spotted a pack of pakaa from the trees; fierce and majestic jungle cats native to the forests. By taking their form, Neeko ran with them across the jungles. While enjoying this cougar-like form she took, the leader of this pack unexpectedly shapeshifted into a seemingly human woman named Nidalee . After a tense standoff, Nidalee reluctantly accepted Neeko into her pack.\nLiving within the pack, Neeko and Nidalee became inseparable as some sort of relationship blossomed between them, feeling a deep sense of kinship for Nidalee. For months, Nidalee enjoyed mentoring Neeko in the art of survival within the jungles and the two enjoyed wandering the wilds together. [ 1 ] Though Neeko began to feel intense romantic feelings for her new friend, these feelings went mostly unrequited, though still blossoming with lots of potential.\nThough Nidalee despised the towns and cities of the civilized people, Neeko constantly felt an urge to curiously explore them and she longed to explore more of the world outside of the jungles. One night, Neeko's Oovi-Kat ancestors came to her in a dream, showing her the pale branches of dead trees and acting as an omen of warning to Neeko of the danger her people are in. With this, Neeko vowed to recreate the Oovi-Kat as an entirely new tribe of her own, wishing to venture out to pursue this personal journey. Though she urged Nidalee to join her, she could not be persuaded and the two parted ways to follow their own quests.\nNeeko continued her journey to rebuild the Oovi-Kat in her own way, welcoming all beings whether they be like-hearted vastaya, yordles , humans and other creatures. Those that join her tribe are easily befriended by Neeko, who in turn vows to defend their sho'ma with her own life.\nWhile travelling, Neeko found herself at a Noxian Outpost at Kalduga . Curious to see if the Noxians were friendly, she snuck into the outpost and took the form of Ewaii, one of the patrolling soldiers at the outpost. While disguised, Ewaii's commander Yubbers began to yell commands at Neeko under the impression that she was in fact Ewaii.\nNeeko then took a mote of Yubber's sho'ma, shifting her shape into his and confusing the soldiers even more. Eventually, Neeko got caught by the actual Yubbers and disappeared into a crowd of people while changing her shape. Mayhem ensued as the guards began to accuse one another and kill each other out of fear as Neeko snuck away. The soldiers abandoned the outpost completely, each going their separate ways and uncertainty of who was secretly Neeko all along. [ 2 ]\nAt some point, Neeko got captured by a band of Piltovan poachers led by 7 Captain Rowain . These poachers sought to catch and eventually sell exotic creatures of the jungles in hopes of making a large profit. A scientist who had been hired by the poachers named 3 Anura , alongside her pet frog Froop, felt sympathy for the captured vastaya and devised a massive escape plan to free her. [ 3 ]\nSuccessfully freed from her capture by the poachers, Neeko found herself back in the jungles and reunited with her old friend Nidalee. Neeko warned Nidalee of the poachers and the two planned to drive them out of the jungle. Under the cover of night, Nidalee and Neeko ambushed the poachers' encampment alongside the rest of the pakaa pack and some 6 other wildlife , driving them out of the forests. [ 4 ]\nNeeko is a female vastaya that has a teen-like appearance and some characteristics of a chameleon, like scales and reptile eyes. She has very colorful hair with glands sprouting out of her head which she uses to capture others' Sho'ma. She wears tribal clothes and walks barefoot.\nNeeko has a very jovial and fun-going personality. She is somewhat innocent and unaware the dangers that surround her. She does not comprehend most of human society and relationships, and some of the words, so she usually creates chaotic scenarios thanks to her naivety.\nNeeko has spent some time with Nidalee and her pack. Though Nidalee wouldn't aid her in her further quests, they parted on relatively positive terms. Neeko is in love with Nidalee, and while the romantic feelings were unreturned, their interpersonal relationship is beginning to blossom. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The two care for each other deeply and Neeko is perhaps the only person outside of her family whom Nidalee would risk her life for.\nNeeko mimicked Ezreal in the jungle during his search for The Elixir of Uloa ."}

Neither wholly woman nor beast, she viciously defends her territory from any and all trespassers, with carefully placed traps and deft spear throws. She cripples her quarry before pouncing on them in feline form—the lucky few who survive tell tales of a wild woman with razor-sharp instincts, and even sharper claws...\nAs a cub, Nidalee was left abandoned in the heart of the eastern jungles that border both Ixtal and Shurima . Though her true origins and how she got to the jungle remains unknown, she was eventually found by the mystical pakaa; cougar-like wildcats native to the jungles. The mother of this pack, roaming with her cubs, sensed a mysterious yet familiar scent on Nidalee and accepted her without hesitation, bringing her back to her den.\nRaised in the pakaa pack and treated as one of their own, Nidalee learned to hunt with her teeth and claws, becoming a capable huntress an honorary member of the pack. As she grew up, Nidalee would randomly enter strange moments of temporary half-transformation as her form shifted into a vaguely humanlike appearance. One night, Nidalee underwent a transformation that caused her to get a fever. Wandering out of the den and delirious, she followed hazy visions of two mysterious figures whispering comforting words to her before fading away. Though she learned from her pakaa siblings to beware outsiders, she felt a sense of comfort from these mysterious figures despite their outsider appearances.\nAt the height of the summer rains, a group of vastayan Kiilash hunters stalked the jungle in search of prestigious beasts to slay and trophies to collect. Angered by the invasive outsiders on their territory, Nidalee's packmother attempted to chase them away but became wounded by the hunters' blades and spears. Before they could deal the killing blow, Nidalee lunged from the undergrowth and pounced on the Kiilash, howling with rage as she tore into them with her claws. Suddenly, she felt the spirit of another heritage rise within her, completely transforming her pakaa body into that of a humanoid figure. Cornered by the hunters and stuck in a strange new body, Nidalee quickly grasped one of the hunters' javelin spears and used the weapon agaisnt them. Angered by her interruption of their hunt, the Kiilash spat out curses in their vastayan language, which Nidalee found she could inexplicably understand partialy.\nAfter the Kiilash fled, Nidalee held her dying adoptive mother in her arms and grieved. Her fellow pakaa siblings surrounded her, wary of her new form but calmed by the comforting scent Nidalee carried. With their packmother now dead, the pakaa willingly accepted the mysterious shapeshifting Nidalee as their new leader.\nAs packmother, Nidalee vowed to protect the jungles from hunters that threatened her pack and her home. Overtime, she learned to better control her mysterious shapeshifting powers, learning to shift between both forms instantaneously. Nidalee also began to grow more adept with her strange humanoid form, learning how to take advantage of the environment to craft new tools, traps and even healing salves completely unknown to the pakaa. Though she still considers the pakaa as her family, she secretly yearned to discover her true origins and learn more about her shapeshifting abilities, hoping to one day find another being similar to her.\nWhen the Oovi-Kat Neeko infiltrated Nidalee's pack by curiously taking the shape of a fellow pakaa and leaping across the jungle with them, Nidalee noticed the strange impostor and shifted into her humanoid form. After a tense standoff between the two, Nidalee introduced herself and reluctantly accepted Neeko into her pack.\nNeeko lived with Nidalee's pack for months, allowing the two to develop a strong and loving relationship with one another. The two felt a kinship unlike anything before, as Neeko felt a strong connection to Nidalee's vastayan heritage. Nidalee often mentored her new companion on the ways of surviving the jungle, while Neeko shared stories and culture of her Oovi-Kat tribe. The two were inseparable, often exploring the jungle together and enjoying its many wonders. At some point Neeko began to feel strong, romantic feelings for Nidalee, which went mostly unrequited for a time. However, Nidalee still shared a deep love for Neeko that she herself cannot fully understand, possibly blossoming into something more for their relationship.\nEventually, Neeko began to get mysterious visions of her ancestors and sought to follow them. Feeling drawn to the cities and towns of the outsiders that Nidalee despised, she sought to form a new tribe of her own and urged Nidalee to join her. Unfortunately, Nidalee could not be persuaded and the two departed as Neeko sought her own destiny beyond the jungles while Nidalee continued her duty of protecting the untouched wilderness of her home. [ 1 ]\nContinuing her protection of the jungles, Nidalee became infamous within the villages and communities of civilized outsiders that she despised. Because of her reputation for leaving very few alive whenever they trespass in her territory, stories about Nidalee began to circulate, describing her as a frightening, shapeshifting beast woman known as the Kashdaji Queen.\nWhile patrolling the jungles one day, Nidalee found a reptilian vastaya caught in a trap laid by a hunter named Percy. Distracting Percy with her human-like appearance, she shifted into a pakaa cougar and pounced on him, threatening Percy to leave the jungles or die. Percy, now injured with a wound from Nidalee's spear, quickly fled the scene alive, frightened by the beast woman he encountered.\nNidalee tending to Kuulcan's wounds after freeing him from a hunter's trap.\nNidalee proceeded to free the vastaya from the trap and heal his injuries, bandaging his tail and shoulder. The vastayan, introducing himself as Kuulcan , began to question Nidalee's heritage despite her insistence of being a fellow vastaya. Kuulcan however was not convinced, stating that he has never met a vastaya that resembled her before, which Nidalee brushed off and ignored before inviting Kuulcan to accompany her and her pack for a hunt.\nThat night, Nidalee and her pack followed Percy to his camp, where he told stories of his encounter to the rest of his colleagues. His fellow hunters however did not believe Percy's accounts of this 'beast woman' and instead pranced around singing lude songs about her. Out of the darkness, Nidalee and her pack quickly killed the rest of the hunters because of their unwillingness to leave her territory before Nidalee herself confronted Percy in pakaa form, stating again that she already warned him to leave before viciously killing him. [ 2 ]\nA drawing made by Milio as part of his letter back, writing back to his family about how he met Nidalee and joined her pack for a time.\nNidalee made another friend with an outsider when she found one of the pakaa cubs taking a nap with a young Ixtali boy under a sunspot. Though initially distrustful of the boy for being a human outsider, she quickly warmed up to him when its revealed that he actually healed the cub with his magic. Learning the boy's name as Milio , she allowed him to travel with the pack on his journey to Ixaocan , quickly befriending him and considering him another honorary cub of the pack. Nidalee accompanied Milio until he reached a nearby village, where he departed from the rest of the pakaa and continued on his journey. [ 3 ]\nAfter Neeko got captured by a band of Piltovan poachers led by Captain Rowain , she was quickly freed by the scientist Anura and found herself reunited with Nidalee and the rest of her pack. [ 4 ] Having already encountered the poachers, Neeko warned Nidalee about them, stating that they were scouring the land for rare beasts to capture and hunt.\nWishing to protect her home and the wildlife, Nidalee gathered Neeko and the rest of the pack to plan an ambush on the the poachers' camp. When it turned night, Nidalee and her pack ambushed the camp, killing most of the poachers and freeing the captured wildlife to help them in the battle, such as the mighty towering 6 pairofants . [ 5 ]\nNidalee is a dark-skinned woman with black hair, emerald green eyes, white tribal markings on her body and a green gem on her forehead. She often wears a pair of earrings fashioned from sharp animal teeth, a necklace adorned with teeth and usually wields a spear with markings on its tip adorned with four animal teeth and a rope on the back. Her usual appearance depicts her with her hair tied into a ponytail, a belt fashioned from animal teeth tied together, revealing clothing made from animal hide and thick fur boots.\nIn her cougar form , Nidalee retains the green eyes, markings and forehead gem shared with her human form, but instead wears a leather collar adored with animal teeth on her neck.\nNidalee is a fearsome huntress who embraces the nature of the wild and takes enjoyment from hunting prey. She is protective towards her pakaa and the jungle they live in, being distrustful towards outsiders who trespass into her tribe's homeland. She usually tries to intimidate them and chase them away, but won't hesitate to kill should they ignore her warnings.\nNidalee was adopted by a pakaa packmother when she was abandoned as an infant in the jungles. Though her origins are an enigma, she was accepted by the pack as one of their own and she grew up deeply loving the other pakaa as her siblings, or kupakaa . After her mother was killed by a party of Kiilash hunters, Nidalee became the pakaa's new packmother, having vowed to protect her family and her home from outside invaders.\nThough Nidalee is unsure of what her true nature is, she knows that she has some connection to the vastaya, identifying as such whenever people ask what she is. When she first underwent a complete transformation, Nidalee inexplicably understood the natural vastayan language and retains her shapeshifting abilities from this heritage.\nA hunting party of Kiilash were responsible for the death of Nidalee's packmother, ultimately causing her first full transformation and allowing Nidalee to take up the mantle of packmother. The Kiilash, angered for their hunt being interrupted, cursed at Nidalee in their vastayan language before running away.\nSince then, Nidalee has developed a disdain towards the Kiilash, such as Rengar , seeking vengeance for the death of her adoptive mother.\nWhen Neeko temporarily joined Nidalee's pack, the two became inseparable and formed an intensely loving friendship with one another. Nidalee gladly taught Neeko many survival skills and the two reveled in the many wondrous sights of the wilderness. When Neeko sought to fulfill her own journey, she urged Nidalee to follow but was unable to persuade her, causing them to depart as Neeko traveled outside of the jungles. When Neeko became freed from being captured by a band of Piltovan poachers, she reunited with Nidalee and the two ambushed the poachers under the cover of night.\nNeeko shared, and possibly still shares, immense romantic feelings towards Nidalee, but these feelings went largely unrequited for a while as Nidalee remains unsure of what her feelings truly mean. Though she's not sure what her relationship with Neeko could blossom into, she's absolutely certain that she deeply cares for Neeko exclusively in a way she has never felt for anyone else. With them reunited, new feelings are beginning to arise as the two share an even deeper bond.\nNidalee met Kuulcan when he was trapped by a hunter named Percy. After freeing him and scaring the hunter into fleeing, the two conversed as Kuulcan questioned Nidalee's heritage, unconvinced that she is a simple vastaya and noting her unique nature. That same night, Nidalee invited Kuulcan to join her and her pack on a hunt, following Percy back to his camp and killing the rest of the hunters for not leaving her territory.\nNidalee dislikes almost all outsiders and 'civilized' peoples, most notably humans. Though her appearance is most similar to that of a human, she holds a disdain for them because of their constant hunting and poaching in her territory and actively denies any claims that she herself is just a human.\nBecause of the Piltovans' continuous hunt for resources in the jungles, they constantly expand and intrude onto Nidalee's territory, poaching the sacred wildlife for profit. Referring to them as brass-bones , Nidalee makes an effort to chase them out of her territory, willing to even kill to do so.\nMost recently, Nidalee has faced off against a band of poachers led by 7 Captain Rowain , having a vicious hatred for one another as Rowain sees Nidalee as an obstacle in his quest to monopolize the beasts of the jungle. These poachers began capturing and hunting down many creatures in Nidalee's territory, which she only learned of after 3 Anura freed a captured Neeko from their captivity and allowed her to alert Nidalee of the poachers. That night, Nidalee and her pack ambushed the poachers at their camp.\nPercy is the hunter that Nidalee caught trying to capture Kuulcan, tossing a javelin into his shoulder and threatening him to leave. When he returned to his camp of hunters, they mocked him for his story about a mythical 'beast-woman' in the jungles, eventually leading to them getting ambushed by the pakaa and getting killed.\nNidalee first found Milio resting under a sunspot with one of the pakaa cubs. Though she was initially distrustful of the young human outsider, she instantly warmed up to him when she learned that he actually saved the cub by healing her with his magic. The boy accompanied Nidalee and her pack during his journey to the city of Ixaocan , quickly befriending the pack and Nidalee. Eventually, Milio made it to his next stop at the nearest town and had to depart from the pack.\nMilio was aware of Nidalee from stories calling her the fearsome 'Kashdaji Queen,' but was ultimately surprised by how loving she truly is once you get to know her. Milio states in his journals that, because of Nidalee's strong personality, she reminds him of his own grandmother in a way. To Milio, Nidalee expresses a softer personality not normally seen by others, considering him an 'honorary pakiti' and even nicknaming him 'Little Fire-Bug.'"}

Her fellow pakaa siblings surrounded her, wary of her new form but calmed by the comforting scent Nidalee carried. With their packmother now dead, the pakaa willingly accepted the mysterious shapeshifting Nidalee as their new leader.\nAs packmother, Nidalee vowed to protect the jungles from hunters that threatened her pack and her home. Overtime, she learned to better control her mysterious shapeshifting powers, learning to shift between both forms instantaneously. Nidalee also began to grow more adept with her strange humanoid form, learning how to take advantage of the environment to craft new tools, traps and even healing salves completely unknown to the pakaa. Though she still considers the pakaa as her family, she secretly yearned to discover her true origins and learn more about her shapeshifting abilities, hoping to one day find another being similar to her.\nWhen the Oovi-Kat Neeko infiltrated Nidalee's pack by curiously taking the shape of a fellow pakaa and leaping across the jungle with them, Nidalee noticed the strange impostor and shifted into her humanoid form. After a tense standoff between the two, Nidalee introduced herself and reluctantly accepted Neeko into her pack.\nNeeko lived with Nidalee's pack for months, allowing the two to develop a strong and loving relationship with one another. The two felt a kinship unlike anything before, as Neeko felt a strong connection to Nidalee's vastayan heritage. Nidalee often mentored her new companion on the ways of surviving the jungle, while Neeko shared stories and culture of her Oovi-Kat tribe. The two were inseparable, often exploring the jungle together and enjoying its many wonders. At some point Neeko began to feel strong, romantic feelings for Nidalee, which went mostly unrequited for a time. However, Nidalee still shared a deep love for Neeko that she herself cannot fully understand, possibly blossoming into something more for their relationship.\nEventually, Neeko began to get mysterious visions of her ancestors and sought to follow them. Feeling drawn to the cities and towns of the outsiders that Nidalee despised, she sought to form a new tribe of her own and urged Nidalee to join her. Unfortunately, Nidalee could not be persuaded and the two departed as Neeko sought her own destiny beyond the jungles while Nidalee continued her duty of protecting the untouched wilderness of her home. [ 1 ]\nContinuing her protection of the jungles, Nidalee became infamous within the villages and communities of civilized outsiders that she despised. Because of her reputation for leaving very few alive whenever they trespass in her territory, stories about Nidalee began to circulate, describing her as a frightening, shapeshifting beast woman known as the Kashdaji Queen.\nWhile patrolling the jungles one day, Nidalee found a reptilian vastaya caught in a trap laid by a hunter named Percy. Distracting Percy with her human-like appearance, she shifted into a pakaa cougar and pounced on him, threatening Percy to leave the jungles or die. Percy, now injured with a wound from Nidalee's spear, quickly fled the scene alive, frightened by the beast woman he encountered.\nNidalee tending to Kuulcan's wounds after freeing him from a hunter's trap.\nNidalee proceeded to free the vastaya from the trap and heal his injuries, bandaging his tail and shoulder. The vastayan, introducing himself as Kuulcan , began to question Nidalee's heritage despite her insistence of being a fellow vastaya. Kuulcan however was not convinced, stating that he has never met a vastaya that resembled her before, which Nidalee brushed off and ignored before inviting Kuulcan to accompany her and her pack for a hunt.\nThat night, Nidalee and her pack followed Percy to his camp, where he told stories of his encounter to the rest of his colleagues. His fellow hunters however did not believe Percy's accounts of this 'beast woman' and instead pranced around singing lude songs about her. Out of the darkness, Nidalee and her pack quickly killed the rest of the hunters because of their unwillingness to leave her territory before Nidalee herself confronted Percy in pakaa form, stating again that she already warned him to leave before viciously killing him. [ 2 ]\nA drawing made by Milio as part of his letter back, writing back to his family about how he met Nidalee and joined her pack for a time.\nNidalee made another friend with an outsider when she found one of the pakaa cubs taking a nap with a young Ixtali boy under a sunspot. Though initially distrustful of the boy for being a human outsider, she quickly warmed up to him when its revealed that he actually healed the cub with his magic. Learning the boy's name as Milio , she allowed him to travel with the pack on his journey to Ixaocan , quickly befriending him and considering him another honorary cub of the pack. Nidalee accompanied Milio until he reached a nearby village, where he departed from the rest of the pakaa and continued on his journey. [ 3 ]\nAfter Neeko got captured by a band of Piltovan poachers led by Captain Rowain , she was quickly freed by the scientist Anura and found herself reunited with Nidalee and the rest of her pack. [ 4 ] Having already encountered the poachers, Neeko warned Nidalee about them, stating that they were scouring the land for rare beasts to capture and hunt.\nWishing to protect her home and the wildlife, Nidalee gathered Neeko and the rest of the pack to plan an ambush on the the poachers' camp. When it turned night, Nidalee and her pack ambushed the camp, killing most of the poachers and freeing the captured wildlife to help them in the battle, such as the mighty towering 6 pairofants . [ 5 ]\nNidalee is a dark-skinned woman with black hair, emerald green eyes, white tribal markings on her body and a green gem on her forehead. She often wears a pair of earrings fashioned from sharp animal teeth, a necklace adorned with teeth and usually wields a spear with markings on its tip adorned with four animal teeth and a rope on the back. Her usual appearance depicts her with her hair tied into a ponytail, a belt fashioned from animal teeth tied together, revealing clothing made from animal hide and thick fur boots.\nIn her cougar form , Nidalee retains the green eyes, markings and forehead gem shared with her human form, but instead wears a leather collar adored with animal teeth on her neck.\nNidalee is a fearsome huntress who embraces the nature of the wild and takes enjoyment from hunting prey. She is protective towards her pakaa and the jungle they live in, being distrustful towards outsiders who trespass into her tribe's homeland. She usually tries to intimidate them and chase them away, but won't hesitate to kill should they ignore her warnings.\nNidalee was adopted by a pakaa packmother when she was abandoned as an infant in the jungles. Though her origins are an enigma, she was accepted by the pack as one of their own and she grew up deeply loving the other pakaa as her siblings, or kupakaa . After her mother was killed by a party of Kiilash hunters, Nidalee became the pakaa's new packmother, having vowed to protect her family and her home from outside invaders.\nThough Nidalee is unsure of what her true nature is, she knows that she has some connection to the vastaya, identifying as such whenever people ask what she is. When she first underwent a complete transformation, Nidalee inexplicably understood the natural vastayan language and retains her shapeshifting abilities from this heritage.\nA hunting party of Kiilash were responsible for the death of Nidalee's packmother, ultimately causing her first full transformation and allowing Nidalee to take up the mantle of packmother. The Kiilash, angered for their hunt being interrupted, cursed at Nidalee in their vastayan language before running away.\nSince then, Nidalee has developed a disdain towards the Kiilash, such as Rengar , seeking vengeance for the death of her adoptive mother.\nWhen Neeko temporarily joined Nidalee's pack, the two became inseparable and formed an intensely loving friendship with one another. Nidalee gladly taught Neeko many survival skills and the two reveled in the many wondrous sights of the wilderness. When Neeko sought to fulfill her own journey, she urged Nidalee to follow but was unable to persuade her, causing them to depart as Neeko traveled outside of the jungles. When Neeko became freed from being captured by a band of Piltovan poachers, she reunited with Nidalee and the two ambushed the poachers under the cover of night.\nNeeko shared, and possibly still shares, immense romantic feelings towards Nidalee, but these feelings went largely unrequited for a while as Nidalee remains unsure of what her feelings truly mean. Though she's not sure what her relationship with Neeko could blossom into, she's absolutely certain that she deeply cares for Neeko exclusively in a way she has never felt for anyone else. With them reunited, new feelings are beginning to arise as the two share an even deeper bond.\nNidalee met Kuulcan when he was trapped by a hunter named Percy. After freeing him and scaring the hunter into fleeing, the two conversed as Kuulcan questioned Nidalee's heritage, unconvinced that she is a simple vastaya and noting her unique nature. That same night, Nidalee invited Kuulcan to join her and her pack on a hunt, following Percy back to his camp and killing the rest of the hunters for not leaving her territory.\nNidalee dislikes almost all outsiders and 'civilized' peoples, most notably humans. Though her appearance is most similar to that of a human, she holds a disdain for them because of their constant hunting and poaching in her territory and actively denies any claims that she herself is just a human.\nBecause of the Piltovans' continuous hunt for resources in the jungles, they constantly expand and intrude onto Nidalee's territory, poaching the sacred wildlife for profit. Referring to them as brass-bones , Nidalee makes an effort to chase them out of her territory, willing to even kill to do so.\nMost recently, Nidalee has faced off against a band of poachers led by 7 Captain Rowain , having a vicious hatred for one another as Rowain sees Nidalee as an obstacle in his quest to monopolize the beasts of the jungle. These poachers began capturing and hunting down many creatures in Nidalee's territory, which she only learned of after 3 Anura freed a captured Neeko from their captivity and allowed her to alert Nidalee of the poachers. That night, Nidalee and her pack ambushed the poachers at their camp.\nPercy is the hunter that Nidalee caught trying to capture Kuulcan, tossing a javelin into his shoulder and threatening him to leave. When he returned to his camp of hunters, they mocked him for his story about a mythical 'beast-woman' in the jungles, eventually leading to them getting ambushed by the pakaa and getting killed.\nNidalee first found Milio resting under a sunspot with one of the pakaa cubs. Though she was initially distrustful of the young human outsider, she instantly warmed up to him when she learned that he actually saved the cub by healing her with his magic. The boy accompanied Nidalee and her pack during his journey to the city of Ixaocan , quickly befriending the pack and Nidalee. Eventually, Milio made it to his next stop at the nearest town and had to depart from the pack.\nMilio was aware of Nidalee from stories calling her the fearsome 'Kashdaji Queen,' but was ultimately surprised by how loving she truly is once you get to know her. Milio states in his journals that, because of Nidalee's strong personality, she reminds him of his own grandmother in a way. To Milio, Nidalee expresses a softer personality not normally seen by others, considering him an 'honorary pakiti' and even nicknaming him 'Little Fire-Bug.'"}

Having won her power through an encounter with the long-imprisoned demon of joy, she has no emotions other than unceasing jubilation—a small price to pay for the vast strength she now possesses. Channeling the demon’s liquid form into a blade of unparalleled might, she stands defiant against ancient threats long forgotten.\nThough her original name is unknown, the girl who would become Nilah was born to a large family in Kathkan ; a nation that saw relative peace and no need for warriors after the fall of their violent neighbor Camavor . Growing up as a bookworm, the girl became obsessed with reading about the many stories and legends of Kathkani mythology including the fall of Camavoran king Viego , the creation of the first dragons and the origin of the universe . She was particularly interested in a story called The Cycle of Ashlesh , which told of a primordial demon named Ashlesh that consumed the extreme forms of joy. According to the legends, the demon was struck down by the gods when it tried to consume their realm , being imprisoned in a lake within the seventh layer of the Kathkani underworld and guarded by a secret order of heroes.\nThe emblem of the Seventh Layer, where the demon Ashlesh is imprisoned.\nThe girl was obsessed with finding this mythical order to stand among them as an equal and learn the truths behind the myths. By deciphering the many riddles within the stories of Ashlesh, the girl discovered that the order was hidden right underneath the heart of the Kathkani capital and set out to find them.\nWhen the girl delved into the heart of the Kathkani capital to search for the order, she went missing and completely disappeared from all public knowledge. Evidence of the girl's existence faded away as written records of her true name evaporated and she faded away from the collective memory of Runeterra.\nAfter ten years, the girl resurfaced and adopted a new name; Nilah, named after the legendary river of fate in Kathkani mythology. It's unknown what exactly transpired over those ten years, but some theorize that Nilah found and trained with the mythical order of heroes while others believe she battled the demon Ashlesh for ten years in the darkness. Some even believe that the girl never even reemerged at all and that Nilah is actually a demonic pretender wearing her flesh as a disguise. Nonetheless, Nilah reemerged with an imprisoned Ashlesh granting her both new abilities and a curse of perpetual joy suppressing all other emotions.\nWith newfound supernatural strength and a liquid blade formed by the power of Ashlesh, Nilah set off on a legendary quest to slay the greatest threats of myths she read about as a child. On her conquest, Nilah faced many foes such as the progenitor dragon Grandmother Viper, the demon of change Imago and the mad demigod Nabavelicus. With the powers of Ashlesh, Nilah faced greater and greater evils that could threaten the safety of her homeland in a flurry of water and color. In doing so, Nilah slowly grew as a legendary hero and monster hunter, hoping to make her name remembered by all that witness her great deeds.\nThe aftermath of Nilah's encounter with a rowdy band of Noxians at Oyster Bill's Oyster Shack.\nAfter the Sentinels of Light defeated Viego, they imprisoned him within Camavor's capital city of Alovedra and bound him in Hallowed Mist placed by Gwen . [ 1 ] Nilah noticed Viego's imprisonment from Kathkan and discovered that the magic binding Viego to his prison had begun to fade. Viego's Ruination magic had adverse side effects that induces a frenzy-like state in all demons, potentially waking up Ashlesh's primordial demon siblings. Discovering this, Nilah sailed westward to find the Sentinels of Light, hoping they can help her find a way to keep Viego imprisoned.\nTraveling across the Guardian's Sea , Nilah arrived in Bilgewater seemingly overnight and instantly began slaying giant sea serpents around the port city. Word quickly spread about her strange arrival and amazing feats as she became a celebrity monster hunter. Asking around Bilgewater for information about the Sentinels, she eventually rented out a room above Oyster Bill's Oyster Shack. While living at the shack, she would often get into dazzling fights with troublesome monsters or locals, such as a rowdy band of Noxians that knocked over her bowl of oysters. [ 2 ]\nNilah confronting the former Sentinel of Light , Malcolm Graves .\nAt some point, Nilah learned about the infamous thief Malcolm Graves , who was one of the Sentinels that helped imprison Viego. Fearing the strange and foreign monster hunter and unsure what she wanted with him, Graves spent weeks avoiding Nilah but eventually faced her in Oyster Bill's Oyster Shack.\nWhile challenging him in combat, Nilah tried interrogating him about Viego and his imprisonment. Graves insisted that Nilah was better off asking his former Sentinel leader Senna and proceeded to fire his gun New Destiny at her. As she narrowly avoided it by hiding in a veil of magical mist , their fight was interrupted as a group of mercenaries entered the tavern with some 2 deep eaters . The mercenaries sought to collect the bounty on Nilah's head placed by their bosses, who were unhappy with the effects Nilah had on their serpent-hunting business. However, Nilah looked past the mercenaries and instead became interested in fighting the deep eaters, which she easily slew. After defeating the mercenaries and their monsters, Graves asked Nilah why she was so interested in Viego as she revealed that the magic keeping him imprisoned has begun fading. Graves explained that the Sentinels actually disbanded shortly after Viego's defeat and that he'd already pawned off his Sentinel gear. Knowing that Graves had no more information to give her, Nilah returned to her room to rest and continue her quest another day. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]\nNilah departing Bilgewater on her vessel the 6 Tidedancer to face the Volibear .\nAfter learning of a new monstrous threat in the Freljord called the Volibear , Nilah saw a perfect opportunity to test her skills once more. Setting off for a distant journey to the north, Nilah gathered a crew of fellow Kathkani monster-hunters and departed Bilgewater on her vessel 6 the Tidedancer . [ 5 ]\nWhile sailing towards the north, Nilah and her crew faced off against an ancient sea monster named 6 Iascylla , also known as the Figurehead of the Deep. As Nilah sought to face more beasts on her journey to the Volibear, she gladly fought against Iascylla alongside her crew. [ 6 ] Though Iascylla proved as a worthy foe, the Tidedancer eventually sailed close to the port city of Piltover and gained the attention of the spirit goddess Janna , who used her powers over the winds to dispel Iascylla, protecting Nilah and pushing her away from the shores of Piltover. [ 7 ]\nAfter leaving Piltover, Nilah continued sailing to the Freljord and landed on the shores of Lokfar . From there, Nilah traveled further north to a treacherous mountain pass where the Ursine , Volibear's most loyal followers, resided and offered blood sacrifices. [ 8 ] Finally facing off against the Volibear himself, the two engaged in brutal combat as Nilah personally challenged him to a duel, insulting Volibear as he saw her as a 'puny girl' with feeble power. The two battled as a violent storm raged and shattered stone mountains, which Nilah used to her advantage as she leapt across floating masses of rock. [ 9 ]\nMorgana welcoming Nilah in her sanctuary.\nAfter the battle, Nilah traveled to Morgana , bruised and bleeding after the battle with Volibear . She and her crew were welcomed in the Veiled Lady's sanctuary, healing their wounds and some much needed breathing space was offered to them. The crew confided in the Veiled One, and shared their stories and missions. However, their meeting was interrupted by the Mageseekers' pursuit of the outcast mages.\nNilah is a tall and slender woman with dark skin and an athletic, lanky physique. Her hair is dark brown in color, very long, and braided into two pigtails that meet at the bottom of her back in the shape of a circle. Her eyes are a bright violet color that changes to a pale blue when she uses her powers. Due to her curse, she has an almost permanent smile on her face that is seen as somewhat unsettling and even intimidating.\nNilah wears a yellow tunic with dark blue, baggy purple pants and a brown glove on her right hand. She has two earrings in the shape of large blue orbs on her ears and her left earring connects to a nose ring by a silver chain. Her outfit has many intricate details made of a dark silvery metal and styled with lots of hand imagery, something that ties her back to her home culture of Kathkan. On her hip she has a metal trinket shaped like two hands holding a bright blue orb made of glass and filled with prismatic water; the prison for the demon Ashlesh.\nWhen Nilah was a young girl she was a shy bookworm constantly daydreaming about the many stories and myths she would read. She took a particular interest in the Cycle of Ashlesh and obsessed over finding the mystical order of heroes that the story spoke of. Having immense knowledge on the many myths of Kathkani culture, she was capable of discovering Ashlesh's prison the Kathkani capital and delved into it in search of knowledge and to become a hero alongside them.\nNilah was very different after her ten year absence; now cursed by Ashlesh with a permanent feeling of intense joy and the suppression of any other emotion. Nilah is actually aware of the emotions that are being suppressed but she cannot outwardly express them, such as how she laments the sorrow of having her very existence erased from her homeland. Despite this, she is a fearless heroine always aiming to save the helpless, especially her homeland. She is incredibly confident and obsessed with slaying giant foes both to reenact the many myths she read as a child as well as to test her own strength.\nNilah speaks with a consistently upbeat tone and happily recites many mantras and prayers from Kathkani culture even in the middle of combat. She has a signature laugh that is known to echo throughout the battlefield whenever she fights a foe.\nNilah initially read stories about Viego's fall and the eventual collapse of Camavor in books and myths. After Viego got imprisoned in Alovedra, his influence threatened Kathkan and drew Nilah's attention. She's more concerned with the implications of his ruination magic and how it affects demons , as Viego's ruinations causes them to go into mad frenzies and could potentially wake up the remaining primordial demons. Discovering Viego's imprisonment is what caused Nilah to travel westward in search of the legendary Sentinels of Light. [ 3 ]\nNilah is on an quest to keep Viego from breaking free in order to save her homeland and stop his ruinations from reawakening the ten primordial demons. To do this, she needs the aid of the legendary Sentinels of Light, whom she only read about in stories.\nNilah encountered Graves in Oyster Bill's Oyster Shack, tracking him down after asking around Bilgewater for information regarding the Sentinels of Light. Her investigation lead her to Graves, who she fought in an attempt to get information and convince him to help her on her quest. Its revealed that the Sentinels of Light actually disbanded shortly after defeating Viego, as Graves already pawned off his Sentinel gear away.\nNilah regards Graves as a friend and fellow hero of legend. Though its unclear whether or not Graves also regards Nilah as a friend, he has shown to be mostly freaked out by her, intimidated by the encounter but also intrigued as he sees her as a 'neat lady.' [ 3 ]\nFiddlesticks is one of the ten primordial demons that Nilah is concerned with keeping asleep. It is the eldest sibling of Ashlesh, the same demon that Nilah encountered and keeps trapped within a jar on her hip. Though Nilah recognizes Fiddlesticks, as well as all of the primordial demons, as a threat to the world, she is supremely confident in her ability to fight them back utilizing the power of Ashlesh. [ 10 ]\nOyster Bill is an oyster-man in Bilgewater who owns Oyster Bill's Oyster Shack. While gaining status as a famous sea-monster hunter in Bilgewater, she rented out a spare room in the shack and currently resides there. Oyster Bill often tells stories about Nilah and her amazing feats to the visitors of his shack, even allowing visitors to speak to her if they wish. [ 2 ]"}

Having won her power through an encounter with the long-imprisoned demon of joy, she has no emotions other than unceasing jubilation—a small price to pay for the vast strength she now possesses. Channeling the demon’s liquid form into a blade of unparalleled might, she stands defiant against ancient threats long forgotten.\nThough her original name is unknown, the girl who would become Nilah was born to a large family in Kathkan ; a nation that saw relative peace and no need for warriors after the fall of their violent neighbor Camavor . Growing up as a bookworm, the girl became obsessed with reading about the many stories and legends of Kathkani mythology including the fall of Camavoran king Viego , the creation of the first dragons and the origin of the universe . She was particularly interested in a story called The Cycle of Ashlesh , which told of a primordial demon named Ashlesh that consumed the extreme forms of joy. According to the legends, the demon was struck down by the gods when it tried to consume their realm , being imprisoned in a lake within the seventh layer of the Kathkani underworld and guarded by a secret order of heroes.\nThe emblem of the Seventh Layer, where the demon Ashlesh is imprisoned.\nThe girl was obsessed with finding this mythical order to stand among them as an equal and learn the truths behind the myths. By deciphering the many riddles within the stories of Ashlesh, the girl discovered that the order was hidden right underneath the heart of the Kathkani capital and set out to find them.\nWhen the girl delved into the heart of the Kathkani capital to search for the order, she went missing and completely disappeared from all public knowledge. Evidence of the girl's existence faded away as written records of her true name evaporated and she faded away from the collective memory of Runeterra.\nAfter ten years, the girl resurfaced and adopted a new name; Nilah, named after the legendary river of fate in Kathkani mythology. It's unknown what exactly transpired over those ten years, but some theorize that Nilah found and trained with the mythical order of heroes while others believe she battled the demon Ashlesh for ten years in the darkness. Some even believe that the girl never even reemerged at all and that Nilah is actually a demonic pretender wearing her flesh as a disguise. Nonetheless, Nilah reemerged with an imprisoned Ashlesh granting her both new abilities and a curse of perpetual joy suppressing all other emotions.\nWith newfound supernatural strength and a liquid blade formed by the power of Ashlesh, Nilah set off on a legendary quest to slay the greatest threats of myths she read about as a child. On her conquest, Nilah faced many foes such as the progenitor dragon Grandmother Viper, the demon of change Imago and the mad demigod Nabavelicus. With the powers of Ashlesh, Nilah faced greater and greater evils that could threaten the safety of her homeland in a flurry of water and color. In doing so, Nilah slowly grew as a legendary hero and monster hunter, hoping to make her name remembered by all that witness her great deeds.\nThe aftermath of Nilah's encounter with a rowdy band of Noxians at Oyster Bill's Oyster Shack.\nAfter the Sentinels of Light defeated Viego, they imprisoned him within Camavor's capital city of Alovedra and bound him in Hallowed Mist placed by Gwen . [ 1 ] Nilah noticed Viego's imprisonment from Kathkan and discovered that the magic binding Viego to his prison had begun to fade. Viego's Ruination magic had adverse side effects that induces a frenzy-like state in all demons, potentially waking up Ashlesh's primordial demon siblings. Discovering this, Nilah sailed westward to find the Sentinels of Light, hoping they can help her find a way to keep Viego imprisoned.\nTraveling across the Guardian's Sea , Nilah arrived in Bilgewater seemingly overnight and instantly began slaying giant sea serpents around the port city. Word quickly spread about her strange arrival and amazing feats as she became a celebrity monster hunter. Asking around Bilgewater for information about the Sentinels, she eventually rented out a room above Oyster Bill's Oyster Shack. While living at the shack, she would often get into dazzling fights with troublesome monsters or locals, such as a rowdy band of Noxians that knocked over her bowl of oysters. [ 2 ]\nNilah confronting the former Sentinel of Light , Malcolm Graves .\nAt some point, Nilah learned about the infamous thief Malcolm Graves , who was one of the Sentinels that helped imprison Viego. Fearing the strange and foreign monster hunter and unsure what she wanted with him, Graves spent weeks avoiding Nilah but eventually faced her in Oyster Bill's Oyster Shack.\nWhile challenging him in combat, Nilah tried interrogating him about Viego and his imprisonment. Graves insisted that Nilah was better off asking his former Sentinel leader Senna and proceeded to fire his gun New Destiny at her. As she narrowly avoided it by hiding in a veil of magical mist , their fight was interrupted as a group of mercenaries entered the tavern with some 2 deep eaters . The mercenaries sought to collect the bounty on Nilah's head placed by their bosses, who were unhappy with the effects Nilah had on their serpent-hunting business. However, Nilah looked past the mercenaries and instead became interested in fighting the deep eaters, which she easily slew. After defeating the mercenaries and their monsters, Graves asked Nilah why she was so interested in Viego as she revealed that the magic keeping him imprisoned has begun fading. Graves explained that the Sentinels actually disbanded shortly after Viego's defeat and that he'd already pawned off his Sentinel gear. Knowing that Graves had no more information to give her, Nilah returned to her room to rest and continue her quest another day. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]\nNilah departing Bilgewater on her vessel the 6 Tidedancer to face the Volibear .\nAfter learning of a new monstrous threat in the Freljord called the Volibear , Nilah saw a perfect opportunity to test her skills once more. Setting off for a distant journey to the north, Nilah gathered a crew of fellow Kathkani monster-hunters and departed Bilgewater on her vessel 6 the Tidedancer . [ 5 ]\nWhile sailing towards the north, Nilah and her crew faced off against an ancient sea monster named 6 Iascylla , also known as the Figurehead of the Deep. As Nilah sought to face more beasts on her journey to the Volibear, she gladly fought against Iascylla alongside her crew. [ 6 ] Though Iascylla proved as a worthy foe, the Tidedancer eventually sailed close to the port city of Piltover and gained the attention of the spirit goddess Janna , who used her powers over the winds to dispel Iascylla, protecting Nilah and pushing her away from the shores of Piltover. [ 7 ]\nAfter leaving Piltover, Nilah continued sailing to the Freljord and landed on the shores of Lokfar . From there, Nilah traveled further north to a treacherous mountain pass where the Ursine , Volibear's most loyal followers, resided and offered blood sacrifices. [ 8 ] Finally facing off against the Volibear himself, the two engaged in brutal combat as Nilah personally challenged him to a duel, insulting Volibear as he saw her as a 'puny girl' with feeble power. The two battled as a violent storm raged and shattered stone mountains, which Nilah used to her advantage as she leapt across floating masses of rock. [ 9 ]\nMorgana welcoming Nilah in her sanctuary.\nAfter the battle, Nilah traveled to Morgana , bruised and bleeding after the battle with Volibear . She and her crew were welcomed in the Veiled Lady's sanctuary, healing their wounds and some much needed breathing space was offered to them. The crew confided in the Veiled One, and shared their stories and missions. However, their meeting was interrupted by the Mageseekers' pursuit of the outcast mages.\nNilah is a tall and slender woman with dark skin and an athletic, lanky physique. Her hair is dark brown in color, very long, and braided into two pigtails that meet at the bottom of her back in the shape of a circle. Her eyes are a bright violet color that changes to a pale blue when she uses her powers. Due to her curse, she has an almost permanent smile on her face that is seen as somewhat unsettling and even intimidating.\nNilah wears a yellow tunic with dark blue, baggy purple pants and a brown glove on her right hand. She has two earrings in the shape of large blue orbs on her ears and her left earring connects to a nose ring by a silver chain. Her outfit has many intricate details made of a dark silvery metal and styled with lots of hand imagery, something that ties her back to her home culture of Kathkan. On her hip she has a metal trinket shaped like two hands holding a bright blue orb made of glass and filled with prismatic water; the prison for the demon Ashlesh.\nWhen Nilah was a young girl she was a shy bookworm constantly daydreaming about the many stories and myths she would read. She took a particular interest in the Cycle of Ashlesh and obsessed over finding the mystical order of heroes that the story spoke of. Having immense knowledge on the many myths of Kathkani culture, she was capable of discovering Ashlesh's prison the Kathkani capital and delved into it in search of knowledge and to become a hero alongside them.\nNilah was very different after her ten year absence; now cursed by Ashlesh with a permanent feeling of intense joy and the suppression of any other emotion. Nilah is actually aware of the emotions that are being suppressed but she cannot outwardly express them, such as how she laments the sorrow of having her very existence erased from her homeland. Despite this, she is a fearless heroine always aiming to save the helpless, especially her homeland. She is incredibly confident and obsessed with slaying giant foes both to reenact the many myths she read as a child as well as to test her own strength.\nNilah speaks with a consistently upbeat tone and happily recites many mantras and prayers from Kathkani culture even in the middle of combat. She has a signature laugh that is known to echo throughout the battlefield whenever she fights a foe.\nNilah initially read stories about Viego's fall and the eventual collapse of Camavor in books and myths. After Viego got imprisoned in Alovedra, his influence threatened Kathkan and drew Nilah's attention. She's more concerned with the implications of his ruination magic and how it affects demons , as Viego's ruinations causes them to go into mad frenzies and could potentially wake up the remaining primordial demons. Discovering Viego's imprisonment is what caused Nilah to travel westward in search of the legendary Sentinels of Light. [ 3 ]\nNilah is on an quest to keep Viego from breaking free in order to save her homeland and stop his ruinations from reawakening the ten primordial demons. To do this, she needs the aid of the legendary Sentinels of Light, whom she only read about in stories.\nNilah encountered Graves in Oyster Bill's Oyster Shack, tracking him down after asking around Bilgewater for information regarding the Sentinels of Light. Her investigation lead her to Graves, who she fought in an attempt to get information and convince him to help her on her quest. Its revealed that the Sentinels of Light actually disbanded shortly after defeating Viego, as Graves already pawned off his Sentinel gear away.\nNilah regards Graves as a friend and fellow hero of legend. Though its unclear whether or not Graves also regards Nilah as a friend, he has shown to be mostly freaked out by her, intimidated by the encounter but also intrigued as he sees her as a 'neat lady.' [ 3 ]\nFiddlesticks is one of the ten primordial demons that Nilah is concerned with keeping asleep. It is the eldest sibling of Ashlesh, the same demon that Nilah encountered and keeps trapped within a jar on her hip. Though Nilah recognizes Fiddlesticks, as well as all of the primordial demons, as a threat to the world, she is supremely confident in her ability to fight them back utilizing the power of Ashlesh. [ 10 ]\nOyster Bill is an oyster-man in Bilgewater who owns Oyster Bill's Oyster Shack. While gaining status as a famous sea-monster hunter in Bilgewater, she rented out a spare room in the shack and currently resides there. Oyster Bill often tells stories about Nilah and her amazing feats to the visitors of his shack, even allowing visitors to speak to her if they wish. [ 2 ]"}

She became gravely ill after an accident in the lower districts of Zaun , and her failing body had to be replaced with exquisite artifice, piece by piece. Accompanied by the extraordinary brass orb that houses her hextech heart, Orianna is now free to explore the wonders of Piltover , and beyond.\nOrianna Reveck was born in Piltover as the daughter of Corin Reveck (Singed), an artificer who designed artificial limbs. She helped her father run his shop as his assistant, but she had an adventurous spirit. Corin refused to let Orianna go beyond her neighborhood and instead took her to the theater, where she was inspired by dancers who told stories of different regions, aspiring to visit them some day.\nWhen news about a disaster in Zaun reached the Revecks' shop, Orianna wanted to help, but Corin forbade her as Zaun was too dangerous. However, she snuck into Zaun at night so she could help the victims of the disaster, supplying them with respirators and even giving her own to save a child who could barely breathe. Corin was angry at her when she returned, but soon she became terminally ill due to her lungs being destroyed by the poisonous gas. Corin spent weeks developing artificial lungs and augmented them into Orianna, but kept her lungs wound with a key so she would not venture off again. As she returned to work, the poison spread to the rest of her body, so the Revecks worked hard to construct artificial parts to replace Orianna's failing body parts. She was eventually able to survive perfectly fine, but at the cost of all but her heart being replaced with bionic parts. She started to lose the memories of who she was before as her humanity began to fade.\nSeveral years later, Corin's heart began to fail. Orianna constructed figurines to sell, but they could not raise enough money to save her father, so out of desperation she made a deal with a chem-baron, whom gave her a hextech crystal. As she paid him, she began to run out of money and knew he would turn to violence next time, so she decided to sacrifice her human heart to save her father. She constructed the Ball , a floating machine which housed the hextech crystal within, designing it to defend and assist her. She anesthetized Corin to begin a surgery to replace his heart with her own. After the surgery was over, she realized that she had sacrificed the last remnant of her humanity, and was now only a machine. She set off to explore Piltover, eager to find her new place as a lady of clockwork. When Corin woke up and found that Orianna had left, he kept a figurine she had created as a memento to his daughter.\nOrianna visited a venue for Sir Fiesterly's Fantastical Fair, waiting until everybody had left. She felt attracted toward a fellow automaton named Fieram , displayed within a glass cabinet. He asked Orianna for her name, and repeated it claiming her name had soft sounds. He told her that he was afraid of the outside world, and was safe in the glass. He demonstrated a magic trick, to Orianna's awe. The two automatons began to converse with each other romantically, with Orianna interested with him to the point where she started to express her emotions, which she had lessened capability over. When Fieram told her of his dreams of seeing the outside world, she was obliged to free him by breaking the lock and the cage. Two security watchmen noticed and tried to stop her from damaging their property. Desperate to take Fieram with her, Orianna urged him to use his smoke-emitting trick, then knocked the two guards into unconsciousness using her Ball. After seeing Fieram repeat his lines, Orianna realized that he was a simple animatronic only following his programming, feeling sadness towards the revelation. As she bode goodbye to Fieram, she left without looking back, but not before seeing what appeared to be Fieram winking in the distance.\nWhen she was human, Orianna had light skin and blue eyes. Her hair was blonde and reached down to the jaw, with it partly tied up in a bun near the top of her head.\nAs a golem her body is now showing white metal segments over most of the body, and her torso is seperated from her hips. The inner parts of her body as well as her joints and windup key is copper coloured. Her metal skirt is bronze coloured, with 6 clockhands sticking out and folowing the skirt from her hips. The edges of both the segments and the clockhands are embellished with a flowing pattern, reminiscent of vines. Near the top part of her chest there is a bronze gear attached that is mirrored on the back but as a pattern on the white segment instead. Her hair remained the same is it's style, but it is now a light brown, and her eyes are now fully blue with a glow emitting from the center. Her fingers are also especially sharp.\nThe Ball follows a design and colour palette as Orianna's parts do, with the white metal segments and bronze parts having the vines around the edges. The Ball has a lens on the front that acts as an eye, glowing blue, from the hexcore contained within it.\nOrianna was helpful and altruistic, willing to do whatever it takes to help others even when dissuaded, and often sacrificed herself in numerous ways to offer others a chance to live. She enjoyed crafting like her father, but as she became more robotic she became more detached from her humanity, yet still retained her concern towards her father. She transplanted her own heart into her father as she saw it as the most logical option. After becoming fully robotic, she now wishes to find her place in the world as a robot retaining her human memories.\nOrianna has trouble expressing her emotions, but is still capable of feeling them. She initially felt love towards Fieram due to being an automaton like her, even going as far as to attack the watchmen due to believing they were trying to stop her from freeing him.

He works in the solitude of a massive smithy, hammered out from the lava caverns beneath the volcano Hearth-Home . There he stokes bubbling cauldrons of molten rock to purify ores and fashion items of unsurpassed quality. When other deities—especially Volibear —walk the earth and meddle in mortal affairs, Ornn arises to put these impetuous beings back in their place, either with his trusty hammer or the fiery power of the mountains themselves.\nNot much is known about Ornn's early life, only tales and stories told around campfires persist, and even then the validity of these stories is not known.\nOne such story tells of when Ornn was young. Looking for a fight with a worthy opponent, Ornn challenged the land around him to a battle. Ornn fought the land, reshaping it with each blow. He headbutted mountains, beat valleys into shape, and shaped the earth into the landscape of what would become known as the Freljord today. When he was tired, Ornn thanked the land for the glorious match, and in return, the land opened itself to him, showing him its core. This gave Ornn the power of the primordial flame, and Ornn then dedicated himself to forging tools and weapons.\nAnother story tells of how after his first home burned down, Ornn made a mountain out of ore, and inside was a forge that channeled the primordial flame from deep within the earth. However, the mountain was too hot even for Ornn, who slept through his first home burning down around him, and so he channeled a sea of cold water into the mountain. It took three days for the home to finally cool, and the ocean had dipped a few inches because of how much water was used. So much steam had risen from the cooling that the sky soon filled with dark clouds and burst with snow. It snowed for a hundred years, and that event is what causes the Freljord to have so much snow even today.\nIt is said that one day, Three Sisters came to Ornn for help. They asked him to dig a hole deep and wide enough to lure their enemies into. Ornn said yes, as he was already planning on digging a hole, and the proposed site was a fine spot. After he was done digging the hole, Ornn returned to his work. Several years later, the Sisters, having endured years of war, came to Ornn again. They asked him to forge a bridge over the abyss, made out of a metal that fell from the sky. This metal was so durable and unyielding that only he could forge it. Ornn agreed, accepting the metal itself as payment. He built the bridge , and so durable was it that it would have stood until the end of time had one sister not ruined Ornn's work by casting spells onto it.\nIn the making of this bridge, Ornn had made a tool from the star metal that he called 'hammer', as he had used it to hammer. Ornn grew so attached to this hammer that even when he had thrown away his favorite spade and eating fork, he could not bring himself to throw away the hammer. He still uses the hammer to forge his creations to this day.\nOne of Ornn's last known creations was made when a troll, Grubgrack the Hideous, challenged him to a drinking contest. Ornn accepted and promised that if Grubgrack won, he would build him a door to protect Grubgrack's riches. When the time came, Ornn lost due to Grubgrack putting a shard of True Ice in his drink, causing it to infinitely melt and put endless amounts of drink in Ornn's cup. Ornn was angry at Grubgrack for cheating, but stuck to his word and built the door. However, once Grubgrack closed the door, he could not get it open, no matter how hard he tried. The door was indestructible, so much so that many years after its creation, a heroic man elected to go through the mountain around the door in order to reach a child stuck behind it.\nGrubrack could not get it open no matter how hard he tried. Ornn did not care, and considered it justice for Grubrack cheating. To this day, some say that just before an avalanche, you can still hear Grubrack's wails, lamenting on his lost riches.\nIn time, like many other demigods, Ornn amassed a group of followers. They were legion of some of the best forgers in Runeterra who came from far and wide to hone their skills under Ornn's guidance. They called themselves the Hearthblood , for they never felt the bitter cold of the Freljord and could bare the intense heat of lava and fire just beneath them, heating up the ground. They presented their work to Ornn, and every so often he would appraise their work, calling the best creations \"passable.\" This was a big compliment from Ornn, as he rarely ever appraised anything, instead electing to let good work speak for itself. He never admitted it, but Ornn secretly cared for the Hearthblood. He admired them for being dedicated to nothing but honing their skills, and not giving him sacrifices or preaching the misconstrued words of their god to people who did not want to hear. They made him smile, though no one could tell because his mouth was hidden behind his beard.\nOne day, Ornn's closest sibling Volibear and his followers came to visit him. Volibear had grown jealous of the love that Ornn's followers freely gave him, and was itching for a fight with Ornn. Volibear came and asked for swords and axes for him and his army of followers, but Ornn refused, not wanting to have anything to do with his brother's warmongering. Volibear threatened to take what his brother wouldn't give, and in return Ornn charged onto Volibear and hit him with his horns so hard that the base of Ornn's mountain shook. They fought for eight days, causing lightning to strike the mountain and molten lava to explode out of the ground. When it ended, the Hearthblood were killed and their home was destroyed. Volibear and Ornn still lived, returning to their individual pursuits. Volibear swore off his brother and shed his rune-inscribed armor, electing to instead fight with tooth, claw, might, and thunder. Ornn returned to his solitary work, continuing to make weapons and armor for years to come.\nOrnn continues his work in solitude, not interacting with anybody. His name is still spoken, but not by many. Every now and then, smoke rises from Ornn's mountain. Some say that he is lighting his furnace to stop the fire underneath the world from going out. Others say that he is building a great weapon. And there are some who claim that he is dead, as he has not been seen in the Freljord since his fateful battle.\nOrnn has a large humanoid-like figure with a square shaped torso and muscular arms, chiseled by his endless work of forging and crafting weapons. He has the head of a ram with large horns and a large red beard that covers up most of his face. Ornn's eyes, left arm, and the tips of his horns glow orange with the heat and power of primordial fire, and he wears nothing but a large metal apron around his torso.\nOrnn is a quiet and stoic individual, not bothering or interacting with anybody unless they come to him. Ornn often will not do things unless he deems it necessary, even using the shortest sentences he can to get his point accross. Ornn is dedicated to his craft and works day and night, and while he takes satisfaction in his work, he does not appraise it, instead electing to let good work speak for itself. He is apathetic to many things, including the people around him. The only people Ornn has ever truly admired or respected were the Hearthblood, and the destruction of their people hurt his soul more than anything else in this world. He has not cared about anyone or anything else since.\nMany in the Freljord know of Ornn, yet few worship him or are considered his 'followers'. Once, an entire village of people known as the Hearthblood worshiped him and followed in his ways of forging and crafting weapons. However, the Hearthblood were all killed and their home destroyed during a battle between Ornn and Volibear .\nOrnn has numerous demigod siblings , including Anivia , Volibear , and many others such as Ildhaurg and the Seal Sister . They were once all close, but soon grew apart due to their own ventures.\nIn myths, it is said that Anivia once accidentally burned down Ornn's Horn Hall after trying to get back at him for felling her favorite perching trees in order to make it. Ornn did not know that it was her that did it and believed that it was his own arrogance that caused his home to burn down. He vowed to never again compliment his own work, which contributed to his stoic and quiet personality.\nVolibear and Ornn were once close, fighting in many battles together. However, as they drifted apart, Volibear grew jealous of the love that the Hearthblood freely gave to Ornn. Volibear and his followers went to Ornn seeking weapons and armor for battle. When Ornn refused, Volibear said that he would take what Ornn would not give, which caused Ornn to attack Volibear. Their fight lasted for eight days and neither of them perished. However, this fight killed the Hearthblood and Ornn has not been seen since.\nLegends say that Ornn dug out the Howling Abyss and built a bridge over it at the request of Lissandra and her two sisters, Serylda ( Sejuani's supposed ancestor) and Avarosa ( Ashe's supposed ancestor). How truthful the myths are is unknown.\nLissandra and her Frostguard have been trying to sabotage the worship of the old demi-gods, including Ornn, in order to deny them power and influence.\nBraum's original tribe has a strong connection to Ornn and hence his magic takes the shape of the ram. Ornn is responsible for making the unbreakable door that is used as a shield by Braum, though he's more annoyed and surprised that Braum managed to take it off the hinges and won't give it back.\nAs a shaman: Udyr is able to harness his power, appearing as two lava orange horns on his shoulders.\nAurora is a friend of Ornn, he welcomed her into his home, although at first he perceived her as a nuisance, over time he grew fond of her and as a sign of his friendship he forged and gave her a magic wand."}

He works in the solitude of a massive smithy, hammered out from the lava caverns beneath the volcano Hearth-Home . There he stokes bubbling cauldrons of molten rock to purify ores and fashion items of unsurpassed quality. When other deities—especially Volibear —walk the earth and meddle in mortal affairs, Ornn arises to put these impetuous beings back in their place, either with his trusty hammer or the fiery power of the mountains themselves.\nNot much is known about Ornn's early life, only tales and stories told around campfires persist, and even then the validity of these stories is not known.\nOne such story tells of when Ornn was young. Looking for a fight with a worthy opponent, Ornn challenged the land around him to a battle. Ornn fought the land, reshaping it with each blow. He headbutted mountains, beat valleys into shape, and shaped the earth into the landscape of what would become known as the Freljord today. When he was tired, Ornn thanked the land for the glorious match, and in return, the land opened itself to him, showing him its core. This gave Ornn the power of the primordial flame, and Ornn then dedicated himself to forging tools and weapons.\nAnother story tells of how after his first home burned down, Ornn made a mountain out of ore, and inside was a forge that channeled the primordial flame from deep within the earth. However, the mountain was too hot even for Ornn, who slept through his first home burning down around him, and so he channeled a sea of cold water into the mountain. It took three days for the home to finally cool, and the ocean had dipped a few inches because of how much water was used. So much steam had risen from the cooling that the sky soon filled with dark clouds and burst with snow. It snowed for a hundred years, and that event is what causes the Freljord to have so much snow even today.\nIt is said that one day, Three Sisters came to Ornn for help. They asked him to dig a hole deep and wide enough to lure their enemies into. Ornn said yes, as he was already planning on digging a hole, and the proposed site was a fine spot. After he was done digging the hole, Ornn returned to his work. Several years later, the Sisters, having endured years of war, came to Ornn again. They asked him to forge a bridge over the abyss, made out of a metal that fell from the sky. This metal was so durable and unyielding that only he could forge it. Ornn agreed, accepting the metal itself as payment. He built the bridge , and so durable was it that it would have stood until the end of time had one sister not ruined Ornn's work by casting spells onto it.\nIn the making of this bridge, Ornn had made a tool from the star metal that he called 'hammer', as he had used it to hammer. Ornn grew so attached to this hammer that even when he had thrown away his favorite spade and eating fork, he could not bring himself to throw away the hammer. He still uses the hammer to forge his creations to this day.\nOne of Ornn's last known creations was made when a troll, Grubgrack the Hideous, challenged him to a drinking contest. Ornn accepted and promised that if Grubgrack won, he would build him a door to protect Grubgrack's riches. When the time came, Ornn lost due to Grubgrack putting a shard of True Ice in his drink, causing it to infinitely melt and put endless amounts of drink in Ornn's cup. Ornn was angry at Grubgrack for cheating, but stuck to his word and built the door. However, once Grubgrack closed the door, he could not get it open, no matter how hard he tried. The door was indestructible, so much so that many years after its creation, a heroic man elected to go through the mountain around the door in order to reach a child stuck behind it.\nGrubrack could not get it open no matter how hard he tried. Ornn did not care, and considered it justice for Grubrack cheating. To this day, some say that just before an avalanche, you can still hear Grubrack's wails, lamenting on his lost riches.\nIn time, like many other demigods, Ornn amassed a group of followers. They were legion of some of the best forgers in Runeterra who came from far and wide to hone their skills under Ornn's guidance. They called themselves the Hearthblood , for they never felt the bitter cold of the Freljord and could bare the intense heat of lava and fire just beneath them, heating up the ground. They presented their work to Ornn, and every so often he would appraise their work, calling the best creations \"passable.\" This was a big compliment from Ornn, as he rarely ever appraised anything, instead electing to let good work speak for itself. He never admitted it, but Ornn secretly cared for the Hearthblood. He admired them for being dedicated to nothing but honing their skills, and not giving him sacrifices or preaching the misconstrued words of their god to people who did not want to hear. They made him smile, though no one could tell because his mouth was hidden behind his beard.\nOne day, Ornn's closest sibling Volibear and his followers came to visit him. Volibear had grown jealous of the love that Ornn's followers freely gave him, and was itching for a fight with Ornn. Volibear came and asked for swords and axes for him and his army of followers, but Ornn refused, not wanting to have anything to do with his brother's warmongering. Volibear threatened to take what his brother wouldn't give, and in return Ornn charged onto Volibear and hit him with his horns so hard that the base of Ornn's mountain shook. They fought for eight days, causing lightning to strike the mountain and molten lava to explode out of the ground. When it ended, the Hearthblood were killed and their home was destroyed. Volibear and Ornn still lived, returning to their individual pursuits. Volibear swore off his brother and shed his rune-inscribed armor, electing to instead fight with tooth, claw, might, and thunder. Ornn returned to his solitary work, continuing to make weapons and armor for years to come.\nOrnn continues his work in solitude, not interacting with anybody.

In time, he learned to embrace the power of his own mortality, and the stubborn resilience that goes along with it. Atreus now opposes the divine as Pantheon reborn, his unbreakable will fueling the fallen Aspect’s weapons on the field of battle.\nAtreus was born on the slopes of Mount Targon , belonging to the tribes of the Rakkor. From a young age, Atreus would train for battle, joining the military unit of the Rakkor, the Ra'Horak. Never particularly talented, nor possessing any innate strength, young Atreus would constantly fail every training regiment and bout he partook in. However, his impressive endurance and relentless fighting spirit always ensured that he would stand back up, in spite of how bloodied and bruised he would be after each encounter. This would earn him the respect of his much more skilled rival and eventual best friend, Pylas, whom Atreus would constantly challenge despite being outmatched in every fight. Through the bloodied and gruesome training circles, Pylas and Atreus would forge a strong bond of brotherhood, a bond that only grew stronger as the two battled proudly for their tribe.\nAtreus and his Ra'Horak companions were ambushed by a barbarian incursion looking to make way into Rakkor territory. The battle would leave most of the patrol dead, save for Atreus and Pylas. The two would seek retribution for their fallen comrades from the Aspect of the Sun, but the Aspect refused to lend aid to fight off the trespassers making their way into their homes. Outraged, Atreus and Pylas vowed to end the fight themselves by making the climb to Targon's peak to acquire power.\nSimilar to the many people that previously attempted to make the climb, the two underestimated the intensity and difficulty of the task. It was a difficult trial, as the two would eventually make their way to the top, but with Pylas dying on the peak of the mountain in Atreus' arms. With Atreus the only one at the peak, the skies opened for the gods to choose their host. Atreus was taken by the Aspect of War, the Pantheon.\nPantheon deemed Atreus too unworthy to wield the power it possessed, but War needed a host body. It took over Atreus' body, stopping Atreus from having any control over the body that Pantheon now inhabited.\nWhat Atreus endured while Pantheon took over his body were visions of Pantheon looking for the Darkin across Runeterra , the living weapons that remained after the Darkin Wars .\nEventually, Pantheon faced Aatrox . Aatrox sought to reach the peak of Targon, with Pantheon arriving to stop the Darkin's ascent. They battled, and it ended with Aatrox driving his blade into the aspect, killing it and erasing its constellation from the skies.\nWith Pantheon gone, Atreus reawoke, finding himself impaled with the Darkin's blade. Bleeding and on the verge of death, Atreus spit on Aatrox's face as an act of defiance. Aatrox was bemused by this and left Atreus to die.\nAtreus stood back up, powered with nothing but bitter rage and regret at his own failings. He stumbled his way into Rakkor territory, until he reached the home of Iula, the widowed wife of Pylas. She nursed him back to health, and as Atreus recovered, he was reinvigorated to keep fighting, finding pride in being a mortal human being instead of a god.\nWhile he recovered, he received news that a barbarian incursion was headed towards the territory that included Iula's farm. Atreus learned that it was led by Aatrox, who convinced the barbarians to invade Targonian settlements. Atreus picked up his weapons and headed to battle to confront Aatrox in an attempt to put an end to the madness.\nWhen Atreus reached the site of battle, Aatrox saw the lack of power flowing through his spear and the scar which seared into both his shield and his body. Despite Aatrox's advantages, Atreus fought him, invigorated by the cries of the people around him. Just before he was about to be defeated, Atreus struck Aatrox's sword arm, detaching the Darkin from its host.\nThis act brought back Pantheon's constellation into the sky, and Atreus made a vow to be the shield, to protect all mortals against those that wanted to destroy them. Forsaking his name, he instead took the mantle of the Pantheon, the Aspect of War.\nAtreus was present when Viego came to Targon to search for a fetter of queen Isolde's soul. He battled the Ruined King at the peak, but was overwhelmed by the time the Sentinels of Light arrived. Atreus' consciousness was subsumed, but Pantheon was resurrected by the king's magic and had taken control of his body. Pantheon attempted to bury the Sentinels with an avalanche, while Viego continued his search. When the Sentinels retaliated, Pantheon summoned an army of ghouls and leapt into battle. He was eventually defeated by Diana , but Viego had already secured the fetter. Pantheon went to the Shadow Isles and guarded the Sentinels as made their final stand against the Ruined King, where Viego would revive his queen. When Viego was defeated, Atreus was freed, and he reclaimed his body from Pantheon.\nAfter the Aspect of War was defeated once again, Atreus visited Iula again. While there, he told her that he had finally given up. After the Aspect was defeated, Atreus lost his celestial powers and couldn't go on. He considered himself defeated after having experienced so much and didn't resist Iula when she pointed his own spear to his chest, even pulling it towards himself so that she could finish the job that the Aspect had started. Iula responded to this with anger. She told him that Pylas had died to make him the protector that he had become and the fact that he was throwing everything away was an insult to her and Pylas' memory. Pantheon left in shame, thinking of what Iula said.\nDespite his despair, Atreus was reinvigorated by what Iula had said. With unclear motives, Atreus traveled into the territory of the Solari, to the location of a portal that they had constructed that went to the peak of Mount Targon. The Solari, along with Leona , fought him. Despite fighting valiantly, Pantheon was knocked off of the cliff that they were fighting on by a comet of unknown origin. At the bottom of the cliff, surrounded by the bodies and weapons of fallen soldiers, Atreus sat in quiet reflection. During this time, he found a reinvigorated passion. With this newfound passion, Atreus' celestial powers returned, and he flew into the night sky.\nAtreus is a physically imposing warrior, with a physique that is carved from a lifetime of training as a soldier. A deep scar runs across his chest, a scar which he received when he was impaled by Aatrox's Darkin blade. He sports the cape of Solstice, a blue ethereal cape with constellations of the sky gleaming from the very fabric. Within certain in-game depictions, when Pantheon has his helmet on, his visage darkens, tying into identity as a faceless soldier of war defending humanity. When his helmet is off, he has a mohawk and sports a thick beard, tied up to keep straight. His face, and much of his body, have golden Solari-based tattoos, which harken back to his Ra'Horak days.\nWhen Pantheon was briefly resurrected after being Ruined by Viego, Pantheon's appearance changed drastically. Like most of the Ruined champions, Pantheon's chest had the dark and green downward facing triangle, signifying his Ruination. The shield he wielded bared a face with some similarity to Atreus. On top of a loincloth, Pantheon wears dark jeans and boots to match. The top of his helmet has a plume with long and thick white fur.\nStoic and unwavering, Atreus as Pantheon possesses a strong fighting spirit. As the stalwart defender of humanity, Pantheon often feels over-encumbered by his duties and his expectations as an Aspect. Despite his failings, he presses forward stubbornly, and he encourages all of his compatriots to do the same.\nHe is not very accepting of most god-like beings with immense powers, which include Aspects, Darkins, Ascendants, and demons alike. Given his own experience with War, Pantheon is hesitant in placing his trust with greater powers, preferring to rely on his own mortal will to fight his battles.\nPylas was Atreus' childhood friend which he deeply respected. Both would climb Mount Targon after the Aspect of the Sun [ 1 ] denied their pleas to fight invading barbarians, with only Atreus surviving the climb.\n3 Iula was the wife of Pylas. Inspired by the actions of her husband and Atreus, she would take up a spear and fight for the mortals of Targon against foes such as 6 Camphor . Years later , Iula would remind a broken Atreus of his purpose, reigniting his determination and warrior's spirit.\nAtreus would fight Leona while trying to reach the peak of Mount Targon.\n5 The Pantheon is the Targonian Celestial Aspect of War, a being that (uncommon among Aspects) completely possessed the body of the current host, Atreus. After the death of the Aspect at the hands of Aatrox , Atreus would be freed from the aspects control. He would breefly be controlled by a resurrected Aspect during the events of the Ruination. Atreus resents The Warrior for his arrogance towards mortals, an opinion that has shaped most of Atreus' viepoints towards god-like beings. He now prides in the power and resilience of mortals, and opposes the greater powers that threaten the world.\nAatrox is instrumental in killing the Aspect that has shackled Atreus since his ascension. Atreus would survive this encounter (with a scar gowing down his chest as a constant reminder), later succeeded in his second fight against the Darkin Blade, reigniting the Aspect's power.\nAtreus inspired many mortals to fight in order to protect others, one of which is 1 Tor , a saga seeker that would eventually fight against a demon known as Camphor.\nAtreus inspired many mortals to fight in order to protect others, one of which is 4 Eshiyme , a revered oracle that was blinded by the demon Camphor, which she would eventually fight against.\n6 Camphor was a demon who stalked the lands of Targon for centuries, using the people very own doubt as a tool against them. Atreus and a group of warriors would eventually confront this demon and fight her until she was slain.\nAtreus and dozens of Ra'Horak fought against Xerath in Nerimazeth .\nAtreus fought and was defeated by Viego, who resurrected the Aspect of War and subsumed Atreus. He was eventually freed from Viego and the Aspect's control after the Ruined King was defeated with the aid of Diana and the rest of the Sentinels of Light ."}

In time, he learned to embrace the power of his own mortality, and the stubborn resilience that goes along with it. Atreus now opposes the divine as Pantheon reborn, his unbreakable will fueling the fallen Aspect’s weapons on the field of battle.\nAtreus was born on the slopes of Mount Targon , belonging to the tribes of the Rakkor. From a young age, Atreus would train for battle, joining the military unit of the Rakkor, the Ra'Horak. Never particularly talented, nor possessing any innate strength, young Atreus would constantly fail every training regiment and bout he partook in. However, his impressive endurance and relentless fighting spirit always ensured that he would stand back up, in spite of how bloodied and bruised he would be after each encounter. This would earn him the respect of his much more skilled rival and eventual best friend, Pylas, whom Atreus would constantly challenge despite being outmatched in every fight. Through the bloodied and gruesome training circles, Pylas and Atreus would forge a strong bond of brotherhood, a bond that only grew stronger as the two battled proudly for their tribe.\nAtreus and his Ra'Horak companions were ambushed by a barbarian incursion looking to make way into Rakkor territory. The battle would leave most of the patrol dead, save for Atreus and Pylas. The two would seek retribution for their fallen comrades from the Aspect of the Sun, but the Aspect refused to lend aid to fight off the trespassers making their way into their homes. Outraged, Atreus and Pylas vowed to end the fight themselves by making the climb to Targon's peak to acquire power.\nSimilar to the many people that previously attempted to make the climb, the two underestimated the intensity and difficulty of the task. It was a difficult trial, as the two would eventually make their way to the top, but with Pylas dying on the peak of the mountain in Atreus' arms. With Atreus the only one at the peak, the skies opened for the gods to choose their host. Atreus was taken by the Aspect of War, the Pantheon.\nPantheon deemed Atreus too unworthy to wield the power it possessed, but War needed a host body. It took over Atreus' body, stopping Atreus from having any control over the body that Pantheon now inhabited.\nWhat Atreus endured while Pantheon took over his body were visions of Pantheon looking for the Darkin across Runeterra , the living weapons that remained after the Darkin Wars .\nEventually, Pantheon faced Aatrox . Aatrox sought to reach the peak of Targon, with Pantheon arriving to stop the Darkin's ascent. They battled, and it ended with Aatrox driving his blade into the aspect, killing it and erasing its constellation from the skies.\nWith Pantheon gone, Atreus reawoke, finding himself impaled with the Darkin's blade. Bleeding and on the verge of death, Atreus spit on Aatrox's face as an act of defiance. Aatrox was bemused by this and left Atreus to die.\nAtreus stood back up, powered with nothing but bitter rage and regret at his own failings. He stumbled his way into Rakkor territory, until he reached the home of Iula, the widowed wife of Pylas. She nursed him back to health, and as Atreus recovered, he was reinvigorated to keep fighting, finding pride in being a mortal human being instead of a god.\nWhile he recovered, he received news that a barbarian incursion was headed towards the territory that included Iula's farm. Atreus learned that it was led by Aatrox, who convinced the barbarians to invade Targonian settlements.

Bearing the legendary hammer of Orlon, a weapon twice her size, this determined yordle has spent untold years searching in secret for the fabled “Hero of Demacia,” said to be its rightful wielder. Until then, she dutifully charges into battle, pushing back the kingdom's enemies with every whirling strike.\n(TBA)\nPoppy is a yordle with light blue fur, and magenta colored eyes. Her hair is styled in two ash-blonde ponytails. Her outfit consists of a red scarf, various armor pieces, and Shieldy mounted on her back.\nPoppy is a dutiful soldier, described as tenacious and determined, but is not always obedient, shown to question Orlon's orders when she disagrees in an inquisitive and almost childishly naive manner. Nonetheless, Poppy was one of the most devoted followers of Orlon's cause, and continues to abide by her mission even centuries after his death, making her true to her word. By Orlon's description, Poppy embodies the characteristics of the true \"Hero of Demacia \", and though her humility prevents her from realizing this, her bravery has helped the kingdom numerous times, making her the one rightful wielder of Orlon's hammer.\nPoppy's hammer belonged to Demacia's founder and weaponsmith Orlon, who passed it on to her on his deathbed. She is searching for the 'Hero of Demacia' meant to wield the hammer (without realizing she is the one). When Orlon passed the hammer to Poppy, he did not specifically identify her as the Hero (or meant to, but died before he could), leading to Poppy's misunderstanding. Poppy and Kled are notable for being Yordles responsible for helping in building the human civilizations they align themselves with (Demacia and Noxus , respectively).\nPoppy knows about the existence of Lulu and Tristana , though it is uncertain what she thinks about them. Lulu states that Poppy and Tristana has \"a little furrow just above her nose when she gets mad\".\nDuring a Black Mist attack by Viego on a Demacian city, Vayne and Poppy fought side by side against the undead army."}

Against monsters , the damage based on their health ratio is capped.\nThe impact creates a field for 1 second that slows enemies within, which then ruptures to deal the same Champions killed from outside standard Attack range physical damage .\nW - Iron Ambassador: Innate: Periodically, Poppy's next basic attack is empowered to throw her buckler, gaining 350 bonus range and dealing 20 − 180 (based on level) Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E) bonus magic damage . After it hits, the buckler then falls to a location near the target over 1 second, landing and remaining there for up to 4 seconds.\nPoppy can move over the buckler to retrieve it, gaining a shield for Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) 13 / 15. 5 / 18% (based on level) of her maximum health for 3 seconds.

If they are in range upon arrival, she deals Champions killed from outside standard Attack range physical damage and carries them along with her for up to 400 units.\nIf the target hits terrain, she stops to deal the same Champions killed from outside standard Attack range physical damage again and stuns them for a duration.\nR - Keeper's Verdict: Active: Poppy charges while being slowed by 15% for up to 4 seconds to increase Keeper's Verdict's range and knock back distance over 0. 5 seconds after the first 0. 5 seconds of the channel. Keeper's Verdict can be recast within the duration.\nRecast: Poppy releases the charge to launch her hammer upwards, dealing Champions killed from outside standard Attack range physical damage to enemies nearby and in an area in front of her and knocking them up for 1 second.\nIf Keeper's Verdict was charged for at least 0. 5 seconds, it deals 100% increased damage and enemies hit are knocked back up-to 3400 units toward the enemy team's fountain . Additionally, if no enemies are hit in front of Poppy , she sends a shockwave that travels in the target direction until it collides with an enemy champion, which causes a hammer to erupt. Targets hit by the shockwave or the eruption receive the charged effects.\nIf the charge is interrupted or completes without reactivation, Keeper's Verdict is cancelled and the ability is put on a 15-second cooldown.\nEnemies knocked airborne are revealed and are rendered untargetable while being displaced if Keeper's Verdict was charged for more than 0. 5 seconds.\nLore:\nconsiderable prosperity.\nPoppy Titles Alias (es) Keeper of the Hammer Hero of Demacia Characteristics Species Yordle Pronoun (s) She/Her Timeline Born: Earlier than 1 AN Weapon (s) Orlon's Hammer Shieldy Personal status Status Alive Place of origin Bandle City Current residence Demacia (No Fixed Abode) Professional status Occupation (s) Hero Seeker Warrior Region (s) Demacia Champion Poppy/LoL Related character (s) Lulu Tristana Galio Shyvana Vayne\nRuneterra has no shortage of valiant champions, but few are as tenacious as Poppy . Bearing the legendary hammer of Orlon, a weapon twice her size, this determined yordle has spent untold years searching in secret for the fabled “Hero of Demacia,” said to be its rightful wielder. Until then, she dutifully charges into battle, pushing back the kingdom's enemies with every whirling strike.\n(TBA)\nPoppy is a yordle with light blue fur, and magenta colored eyes. Her hair is styled in two ash-blonde ponytails. Her outfit consists of a red scarf, various armor pieces, and Shieldy mounted on her back.\nPoppy is a dutiful soldier, described as tenacious and determined, but is not always obedient, shown to question Orlon's orders when she disagrees in an inquisitive and almost childishly naive manner. Nonetheless, Poppy was one of the most devoted followers of Orlon's cause, and continues to abide by her mission even centuries after his death, making her true to her word. By Orlon's description, Poppy embodies the characteristics of the true \"Hero of Demacia \", and though her humility prevents her from realizing this, her bravery has helped the kingdom numerous times, making her the one rightful wielder of Orlon's hammer.\nPoppy's hammer belonged to Demacia's founder and weaponsmith Orlon, who passed it on to her on his deathbed. She is searching for the 'Hero of Demacia' meant to wield the hammer (without realizing she is the one). When Orlon passed the hammer to Poppy, he did not specifically identify her as the Hero (or meant to, but died before he could), leading to Poppy's misunderstanding. Poppy and Kled are notable for being Yordles responsible for helping in building the human civilizations they align themselves with (Demacia and Noxus , respectively).\nPoppy knows about the existence of Lulu and Tristana , though it is uncertain what she thinks about them. Lulu states that Poppy and Tristana has \"a little furrow just above her nose when she gets mad\".\nDuring a Black Mist attack by Viego on a Demacian city, Vayne and Poppy fought side by side against the undead army."}

Now, stalking the dank alleys and backways of his former hometown, he uses his new supernatural gifts to bring a swift and gruesome end to those who make their fortune by exploiting others—and a city that prides itself on hunting monsters now finds a monster hunting them.\nIn life and in his youth, Pyke worked on the slaughterhouse docks to earn a living, he found work at the Red Dock and it didn't take him long to get used to the business, the hard work and its minimum wage. But deep down he aspired for more and every time he saw a crew arrive with huge creatures to sell his desire grew more and more, he worked hard and finally managed to stand out and join a crew. Pyke demonstrated great talent for Buhru -style harpoon hunting, earning the title of the best harpooner of his time.\nOne day while his ship was sailing, a Jaull Fish appeared, one of the most coveted and strongest monstrous fish in all of Runeterra since its oil had magical properties. Pyke without hesitation jumped into the sea into the mouth of the fish to try to kill it, but the fish emitted a powerful scream which called a herd of Jaull Fish which began to push the boat.\nThe desperate captain was forced to cut Pyke's lifeline.

Last in line to succeed her parents, she faces those who stand in her way with brash confidence and unprecedented mastery over elemental magic. With the land itself obeying her every command, Qiyana sees herself as the greatest elementalist in the history of Ixaocan—and by that right, deserving of not only a city, but an empire.\nQiyana was born into the royal family of Ixaocan, the Yunalai, being the last of her nine sisters in the line of succession and grew up thinking that the throne would never be hers. Wishing to know what her role would be in her family and her place in Ixaocan.\nQiyana was educated in the elemental magical arts of Ixtal, she proved to be one of the best students of her time and not only that but at a very early age she mastered powerful techniques and spells that her older sisters were still struggling to achieve. Seeing the potential within her, Qiyana began to believe that the throne of Yun Tal should be hers.\nAs she grew, Qiyana's magical powers increased enormously, being able to perfectly master three types of elemental magic, Earth, Water and Nature. With her powers, her pride grew more and more, proclaiming herself as the Empress of the Elements.\nAs time went by, Qiyana began to try to get her parents' attention because she wanted to prove herself and was scandalized when they chose one of her sisters and not her. Inessa, her older sister, clashed with her the most, having very heated arguments until it got to the point where Inessa challenged Qiyana to a ritual combat to teach her sister some humility.\nThe battle was fierce but finally Qiyana not only emerged victorious but also left Inessa paraplegic. Qiyana expected her reward but her parents were horrified by how she left her sister and refused to give her her reward. Qiyana was quite hurt and resentful by her parents' response, but then she realized that the entire town of Ixaocan was quite impressed with her powers, giving her one of the things she most wanted to have, respect.\nHowever, Qiyana was not satisfied with recognition from all of Ixaocan. She needed the entire world to know the strength of her city, and more importantly, herself. Qiyana was disgusted by the increasing number of foreign visitors coming to their jungles to drain the land of its natural resources. She believed that if she showed them Ixtal's elemental might, these foreigners would run away in terror, and in her parents' court she proposed a plan of action against the \"outlanders\".\nQiyana's parents did not approve, of course, stating that making contact with the miners could destroy Ixacoan's hidden, isolationist position in Runeterra, inviting war, disease, and hatred, putting hundreds of years of peace in jeopardy. But Qiyana didn't care what they had to say and disobeyed her parents' orders, raiding a Piltovan mining site, destroying it and killing all the workers but one. She let the last miner go, and told him to spread the message of the elementalist sorceress who destroyed the mine. When she returned, Qiyana told everyone about the massacre, much to her parents' fury, as Qiyana's actions only caused the Piltovans to send even more miners and soldiers to the jungle.\nHer parents, full of sadness, were forced to imprison their daughter in the dungeons of Ixaocan to decide how to punish her for the crime she committed against the kingdom. But before her trial began the elementalists of the high court spoke on Qiyana's behalf, stating that, while her actions were reckless, she was one of the most powerful elementalists Ixaocan had ever known. And that it would be foolish to keep her locked up and instead, she should be appointed to defend the city. In addition to the fact that the entire city was full of people who admired Qiyana's skill and talent and that she could inspire them to greatness, this made her parents reluctantly agree to release her but not before making her swear that she would not challenge them again.\nQiyana is a young and attractive Ixtali woman with tanned skin and wavy shoulder-length white hair. She has a round face and button nose, and yellow eyes. She is of short and curvaceous stature, with a trim waist, broad hips, and thick thighs.\nShe wears a strapless blue-green dress with a black midsection, detailed all over in gold. On her lower half she wears black leggings and a pair of open-toed sandals. She lavishes her appearance with jewellery and makeup, wearing a golden tiara, bracelets on her wrists and upper arms, and a necklace, all of which are inlaid with large green gems. Her eyes are decorated with golden-green eye shadow, and her nails are also painted in her signature green.\nThough she does possess the skill to back it up, Qiyana is a proud and arrogant woman who brags often and loudly for all to hear about her prowess with elemental magic, her ostentatious nature reflected even in her choice of attire. She thinks very highly of herself and is fully convinced she deserves the throne regardless of her place in the line of succession.\nShe is extremely competitive, proactive, and determined. When challenged by her older sister Inessa to ritual combat, Qiyana displayed a ruthless side by not only rising to the challenge but crippling her sister in the fight to assert how seriously she takes her desire to rise to the top and ultimately become Empress.\nQiyana's parents neglected her due to her being the youngest of her 9 sisters, and thus furthest from the throne . [ 1 ] As a result of her parent's preferential treatment, Qiyana does not have a good relationship with her siblings.\nInessa, the eldest daughter and 12 years Qiyana's senior, sought to humble her by besting her in ritual combat, but was instead defeated and crippled. Mara, the youngest of Qiyana's elder sisters, conceded her prefectship over Tikras after Qiyana exposed the hidden paths between villages in Ixtal . The Piltovan raid that followed killed about half the populace, and nearly Mara herself. Unbeknownst to Mara, Qiyana planned the entire ordeal in order to take over as prefect, amassing additional power and support from Ixtal citizens."}

She and her legendary eagle , Valor , share an unbreakable bond, and their foes are often slain before they realize they are fighting not one, but two of the kingdom’s greatest heroes. Nimble and acrobatic, Quinn takes aim with her crossbow while Valor marks their elusive targets from above, making them a deadly pair on the battlefield.\nQuinn and her twin brother Caleb were born in Uwendale to a weaponsmith and a ranger. When 7 King Jarvan III visited the village, they were impressed by the knights in their shining armor, and began to imitate them. Their father supported them in their endeavors, but as they grew older, the children took after their mother and spent time ranging in the wilds.\nAs young adults, Quinn and her brother were a formidable team of rangers, proficient in tracking and hunting prey. Quinn used a bow, while Caleb used a spear.\nQuinn and Caleb were hired to accompany a hunting parting of nobles from the capital. The nobles hunted a giant Tuskvore , but did not manage to kill it. The wounded beast turned on the hunters, and the twins intervened. As they drove off the creature, it killed Caleb. The leader of the nobles, 2 Lord Barrett Buvelle , helped Quinn bury her brother, who saved their life.\nThe death of Caleb broke Quinn, she couldn't focus on her tasks and would often make mistakes in the wilderness. A few months after the incident, Lady Lestara Buvelle visited Quinn's family and asked what her house could do for the grieving family. Quinn did not have an answer for her; She politely thanked her for the offer and turned her away.\nOne year after Caleb's death, Quinn returned to his grave as she often did. Due to her carelessness, she was taken by surprise when a tuskvore attacked her. She noticed it was the same beast that killed her brother, from the eye he took out before his death. Quinn fought the tuskvore, but found that she couldn't win. Just as it was about to kill her too, an Azurite Eagle swooped in and distracted the creature. With this help, Quinn managed to kill the tuskvore.\nShe nursed the wounded bird back to health and named him Valor . The connection she felt with the eagle helped Quinn, and she once again contemplated how to serve Demacia . With help from her father, she crafted her repeater crossbow, then journeyed to the capital to become a ranger-knight.\nAt the funeral of Lord Barrett Buvelle, Quinn spoke with his widow Lestara Buvelle. Lestara expressed her gratitude for saving his life two years ago, and asked again how she could repay Quinn. Quinn hesitated at first, then asked Lady Buvelle to sponsor her for knighthood. Lestara agreed and spoke with Tianna Crownguard , and Quinn became a ranger-knight in the same week.\nAs ranger-knight, Quinn served in the Demacian military with her companion Valor. She has traveled far across Runeterra in her missions, including the Freljord and Noxian-held territories . [ 1 ]\nIn the late autumn of 996 AN , Quinn received orders from Tianna Crownguard . She was to meet with Garen and a detachment of the Dauntless Vanguard and escort them to Nockmirch , but was distracted by a burned cabin in the woods. There she met up with 3 Greenfang Warden Dalin, and decided to pursue the attackers. They tracked the group to the eastern border, where Quinn confronted them. She learned that the widow and her child who lived in the cabin were not abducted, but that she willingly returned to Skaggorn with her brother. It was forbidden to leave the country due to the ongoing rebellion, but the group knew of a secret passage unknown to the Demacian guards. Quinn decided to still let them go, ordering Dalin to stand down. She then told him to ensure a watchtower was built so this could not happen again, and ran off to make her original assignment.\nAfter running through the forest for multiple days and nights, Quinn met with the Dauntless Vanguard and boarded the ship \"Stormbright\" . As ranger, it was her duty to scout ahead and make sure the environment was safe. She was the one to discover a fortified bridge spanning the ravine between Rijenland and Alderburg , and later discovered the noxian army nearby. She rushed back to Alderburg to alert Garen , and they left with the Vanguard. Quinn was supposed to make it back to Demacia and alert them, but she was wounded while trying to open the gates of the bridge for the trapped soldiers. Valor, despite also being wounded, made it out and managed to lead 5 Silverwing riders to the trapped Demacians. Quinn and the survivors then made it back to the Great City to recover from their wounds.\nQuinn continues to lead the rangers in the fight against Sylas' rebellion. Their involvement seems to help the soldiers. [ 2 ]\nQuinn is a lean, fierce-looking woman with stern features. [ 3 ] She has amber eyes, described as similar to Valor's golden eyes. [ 4 ] She usually wears light leather armor, and also travels with no or only a light pack. Quinn is almost always accompanied by her Azurite Eagle , Valor.\nQuinn is friendly and well-liked with her subordinate rangers, rarely using her superior position to give direct orders. She takes her duty seriously and always tries to protect those she is in charge of. She does what is right, even when it goes against rules or the law. [ 5 ]\nShe is generally wary of strangers and \"doesn't like people overmuch as a rule\". She is more comfortable alone in the wild than among company. Cithria notes that she exudes an \"easy confidence\". [ 3 ]\nQuinn's twin brother Caleb died while defending Barrett Buvelle, the adoptive father of Sona , from a tuskvore attack. After his death, Lestara Buvelle petitioned to Tianna Crownguard to let Quinn become a ranger-knight.\nQuinn is the leader of the Demacian Rangers , whose known members include 6 Genevieve Elmheart and her 5 greathorn named Cern , the Yordle 4 Betrand and 3 his badgerbear Beemer , the 3 Greenfang Warden Dalin and his dog Rigby. She's receives her orders from High Marshal Tianna Crownguard and carries them out dutifully.\nShe has worked with Garen and the Dauntless Vanguard on their expedition to the Nockmirch .

She and her legendary eagle , Valor , share an unbreakable bond, and their foes are often slain before they realize they are fighting not one, but two of the kingdom’s greatest heroes. Nimble and acrobatic, Quinn takes aim with her crossbow while Valor marks their elusive targets from above, making them a deadly pair on the battlefield.\nQuinn and her twin brother Caleb were born in Uwendale to a weaponsmith and a ranger. When 7 King Jarvan III visited the village, they were impressed by the knights in their shining armor, and began to imitate them. Their father supported them in their endeavors, but as they grew older, the children took after their mother and spent time ranging in the wilds.\nAs young adults, Quinn and her brother were a formidable team of rangers, proficient in tracking and hunting prey. Quinn used a bow, while Caleb used a spear.\nQuinn and Caleb were hired to accompany a hunting parting of nobles from the capital. The nobles hunted a giant Tuskvore , but did not manage to kill it. The wounded beast turned on the hunters, and the twins intervened. As they drove off the creature, it killed Caleb. The leader of the nobles, 2 Lord Barrett Buvelle , helped Quinn bury her brother, who saved their life.\nThe death of Caleb broke Quinn, she couldn't focus on her tasks and would often make mistakes in the wilderness. A few months after the incident, Lady Lestara Buvelle visited Quinn's family and asked what her house could do for the grieving family. Quinn did not have an answer for her; She politely thanked her for the offer and turned her away.\nOne year after Caleb's death, Quinn returned to his grave as she often did. Due to her carelessness, she was taken by surprise when a tuskvore attacked her. She noticed it was the same beast that killed her brother, from the eye he took out before his death. Quinn fought the tuskvore, but found that she couldn't win. Just as it was about to kill her too, an Azurite Eagle swooped in and distracted the creature. With this help, Quinn managed to kill the tuskvore.\nShe nursed the wounded bird back to health and named him Valor . The connection she felt with the eagle helped Quinn, and she once again contemplated how to serve Demacia . With help from her father, she crafted her repeater crossbow, then journeyed to the capital to become a ranger-knight.\nAt the funeral of Lord Barrett Buvelle, Quinn spoke with his widow Lestara Buvelle. Lestara expressed her gratitude for saving his life two years ago, and asked again how she could repay Quinn. Quinn hesitated at first, then asked Lady Buvelle to sponsor her for knighthood. Lestara agreed and spoke with Tianna Crownguard , and Quinn became a ranger-knight in the same week.\nAs ranger-knight, Quinn served in the Demacian military with her companion Valor. She has traveled far across Runeterra in her missions, including the Freljord and Noxian-held territories . [ 1 ]\nIn the late autumn of 996 AN , Quinn received orders from Tianna Crownguard . She was to meet with Garen and a detachment of the Dauntless Vanguard and escort them to Nockmirch , but was distracted by a burned cabin in the woods. There she met up with 3 Greenfang Warden Dalin, and decided to pursue the attackers. They tracked the group to the eastern border, where Quinn confronted them. She learned that the widow and her child who lived in the cabin were not abducted, but that she willingly returned to Skaggorn with her brother. It was forbidden to leave the country due to the ongoing rebellion, but the group knew of a secret passage unknown to the Demacian guards. Quinn decided to still let them go, ordering Dalin to stand down. She then told him to ensure a watchtower was built so this could not happen again, and ran off to make her original assignment.\nAfter running through the forest for multiple days and nights, Quinn met with the Dauntless Vanguard and boarded the ship \"Stormbright\" . As ranger, it was her duty to scout ahead and make sure the environment was safe. She was the one to discover a fortified bridge spanning the ravine between Rijenland and Alderburg , and later discovered the noxian army nearby. She rushed back to Alderburg to alert Garen , and they left with the Vanguard. Quinn was supposed to make it back to Demacia and alert them, but she was wounded while trying to open the gates of the bridge for the trapped soldiers. Valor, despite also being wounded, made it out and managed to lead 5 Silverwing riders to the trapped Demacians. Quinn and the survivors then made it back to the Great City to recover from their wounds.\nQuinn continues to lead the rangers in the fight against Sylas' rebellion. Their involvement seems to help the soldiers. [ 2 ]\nQuinn is a lean, fierce-looking woman with stern features. [ 3 ] She has amber eyes, described as similar to Valor's golden eyes. [ 4 ] She usually wears light leather armor, and also travels with no or only a light pack. Quinn is almost always accompanied by her Azurite Eagle , Valor.\nQuinn is friendly and well-liked with her subordinate rangers, rarely using her superior position to give direct orders. She takes her duty seriously and always tries to protect those she is in charge of. She does what is right, even when it goes against rules or the law. [ 5 ]\nShe is generally wary of strangers and \"doesn't like people overmuch as a rule\". She is more comfortable alone in the wild than among company. Cithria notes that she exudes an \"easy confidence\". [ 3 ]\nQuinn's twin brother Caleb died while defending Barrett Buvelle, the adoptive father of Sona , from a tuskvore attack. After his death, Lestara Buvelle petitioned to Tianna Crownguard to let Quinn become a ranger-knight.\nQuinn is the leader of the Demacian Rangers , whose known members include 6 Genevieve Elmheart and her 5 greathorn named Cern , the Yordle 4 Betrand and 3 his badgerbear Beemer , the 3 Greenfang Warden Dalin and his dog Rigby. She's receives her orders from High Marshal Tianna Crownguard and carries them out dutifully.\nShe has worked with Garen and the Dauntless Vanguard on their expedition to the Nockmirch . Quinn and Garen like and respect each other."}

To the humans of the Ionian highlands, his name had long been synonymous with wild festivals, uncontrollable parties, and anarchic music. But this energetic, traveling showman has left his old life behind, dedicating himself to the cause of his lover, the rebel Xayah . Together, they seek to free Ionia’s wild magic, restoring the vastaya’s birthright.\nThe Lhotlan vastaya once lived on the ancient, mystical borders of Ionia’s deep forests, on the eastern island of Qaelin. It was a place where magic was breathed like air, and time had little meaning. To these chimeric creatures, the lands of mortals were an unforgiving desert, virtually devoid of magic—and over the centuries, that desert only grew, encroaching on the vastaya’s territories.\nRakan was born into a tribe in decline, yet he never gave up hope.\nLike his brethren, Rakan watched as human settlements continued to expand, damming the flow of Ionia’s wild, chaotic magic for their own safety. Many tribes sent emissaries to negotiate with them, securing treaties to protect the mystical energy the vastaya needed to thrive. Yet over and over again, these promises were broken.\nDisillusioned, most vastaya became increasingly isolationist as they clung to their remaining lands. But young Rakan advocated a different path. The battle-dancer believed that mortals could be convinced to let wild magic run free if they could only appreciate its beauty, and he boasted that he was the one to make them see it. For this, he was labeled mu’takl —distrusted as a human sympathizer, and collaborator.\nRakan left the Lhotlan tribe, determined to spread the song of his people across Ionia. He was an entertaining rogue, a welcome performer at any tavern or village carnival, but over the years he realized that was all he was to mortals—no matter how many dances and songs he performed, no matter how much he enthralled the crowds, he merely provided diversion to drunken revelers.\nRakan grew restless, finding himself without purpose... until he had a chance encounter with Xayah, a fellow Lhotlan, at the harvest festival in Vlonqo.\nSeeing her in the crowd, Rakan sang one of his old songs, entrancing the entire town with his gleaming plumage. Though countless human and vastayan women had fallen for him in the past, this violet raven seemed immune to his charms, though not uninterested.\nHow could she see him and yet choose not to follow him? It was a puzzle with no easy answer.\nIntrigued, the battle-dancer approached Xayah and asked after the welfare of their tribe. When she told him that the Lhotlan had lost the last of their lands, Rakan howled with rage. This finally seemed to impress Xayah, and she assured him that there was still hope: she was part of something greater, a rebellion of sorts, to take back what the vastaya had lost. Not just for the Lhotlan, but for all tribes.\nRakan was thunderstruck. Here was a chance for him to redeem his people, a cause he was willing to die for. He implored Xayah to let him accompany her, and she agreed—as long as he carried his weight.\nAnd, as Xayah would soon learn, Rakan’s dances were as impressive in battle as they were on stage. He called himself the greatest battle-dancer in Lhotlan history, a boast that none could refute. His grand entrances and dazzling acrobatics distracted and befuddled enemies, before Xayah felled them with her razor-sharp quills. In any dangerous situation, they fought together with uncanny harmony.\nDuring their travels, Rakan became fascinated by how Xayah interacted with the world. She seemed always prepared, aloof, and focused... whereas he was absent-minded, affable, and lacking seriousness. Although Rakan would often forget her carefully laid plans, he made up for it with his ability to read the emotions of others, using charisma and insight to persuade them. The two vastaya were so different, and yet they achieved great feats, each one’s strengths complementing the other’s weaknesses.\nSoon enough, Rakan couldn’t imagine life without Xayah, and it was clear that she felt the same for him. The pair pledged themselves to each other in the midst of a raucous tavern brawl.\nYet they did not see eye to eye in all things. Where she viewed the world as black and white, with mortals always the enemy, he had more compassion, and believed some of them were redeemable. Despite this difference, Rakan was certain that his and Xayah’s love for each other would bear them through the storms that lay ahead.\nThrough Xayah, Rakan has found purpose. Inspired by his partner’s singular drive, Rakan has made her crusade his own, and together they will fight to reclaim the First Lands for the vastaya.\nRakan has white hair, which is accentuated by a bold red stripe running through it. His small red cape conceals the base of vibrant yellow plumage, which cascades down like a regal cape. Adorning the cape is a single bird skull which keeps the cape in place. Shirtless, he showcases two bracers on his arms, concealing additional yellow plumage underneath. Rakan wears azure pants which secured by a red rope belt adorned with bird skulls. True to his Lhotlan lineage, Rakan bears avian features such as bird legs and pointed, feathered ears.\nAs the title suggests, he's as charming as they come, being an emotionally aware guy and incredibly graceful. Because this he can be a flamboyant and showy performer, as he is energetic and confident. But he is also brave and loyal, and compassionate and unlike his lover, Xayah, he tends to act on instinct than planning.\nRakan is a Lhotlan Vastayan who travels Ionia as a wandering entertainer. After meeting and getting in a relationship with Xayah , both travel Ionia to preserve Ionia's natural magic from being controlled by humans. They are not married, since Xayah wants to hear him proposing to her everyday.\nRakan and Xayah fought Zed and his Order of the Shadow in Wild Magic to prevent them from harvesting a magical grove for the Kashuri Armories, the creators of Jhin's Whisper ."}

Her insatiable hunger has laid waste to entire regions of the once-great empire of Shurima —merchants, traders, even armed caravans, will go hundreds of miles out of their way to avoid her and her offspring's hunting grounds. All know that once Rek'Sai is seen on the horizon, death from below is all but guaranteed.\nRek'Sai originated in the Void , as the queen of the Xer'Sai . Thousands of years ago, she entered Runeterra through a portal to Shurima , where she and the Xer'Sai made a home within the sands, claiming parts of the region as their hunting territory and hunting anyone they found. Alongside her brood, Rek'Sai devoured thousands of people in the desert, causing the Shurimans to fear her as a bringer of death.\nRek'Sai was targeted by a Noxian hunting team attended by Aelon, a noble who intended to capture her to use in the Noxian arenas. Initially arrogant and eager to pursue her for the sake of glory, he began to humble to the Shuriman residents over time and listened to their stories of Rek'Sai. But after witnessing the destruction Rek'Sai and her brood were capable of, Aelon began to doubt his faith in the hunt. Aelon's mind was scarred by witnessing Rek'Sai's carnage firsthand, seeing her as death incarnate. While he survived the encounter thanks to his Shuriman companions' warnings, the traumatic experience caused Aelon to become disillusioned with Noxus' values, making him decide to leave the empire.\nRek'Sai's territory in the Sai Kahleek was visited by six Shuriman teenagers and their camel. As they discussed the myths about Rek'Sai they had heard about, they heard a bell alarming them of something coming from behind them. The boys felt a jolt of Void energy before seeing their camel die within seconds. Disturbed, they tried to tiptoe towards the black rocks nearby, but the rocks moved further away.\nThey eventually came across a gigantic tunnel made by Rek'Sai herself, and decided to go into the tunnel in hope of finding water. Suddenly, Rek'Sai leapt out from the burrow and killed Xalee by crushing his spine with her fangs. The boys' leader, Shahib, instructed them to duck before Rek'Sai dragged Kall into her burrow. They managed to escape from the burrow but Rek'Sai followed them out, lunging at Jaheje but missing. She burrowed into the sand and knocked the group's youngest member VezKah into the air, killing him upon landing. Rek'Sai chased the remaining boys into the valley, cornering them and leaving them no choice but to run straight ahead. When Caleeb was too exhausted to continue, Rek'Sai killed him too. After witnessing a portal directly leading to the Void, the Xer'Sai's true home, Shahib encouraged Jaheje to escape and tell the story, offering to sacrifice himself to Rek'Sai as a distraction. After seeing Shahib's body getting desecrated by Rek'Sai, Jaheje broke down in tears from all the trauma he went through.\nReaching the Renek River as the only survivor of the group, Jaheje told his story. Few believed him at first, but many eventually realized that Jaheje was right upon witnessing the truth of the Sai Kahleek. He taught the other cast-off boys of Shurima how to survive the Sai Kahleek, warning them of Rek'Sai.\nRek'Sai is only mentioned by Kai'Sa during her exploration of a chasm in Shurima , after meeting Taliyah and other rock weavers.

She has a shark-like fin on her back which glows with Void energy when she senses her prey.\nRek'Sai is a primitive, animalistic predator who only communicates through roars and chitters. Her main drive is to burrow through the Shuriman desert and savagely consume every lesser being she senses.

Her childhood was one of misery and horror, enduring unspeakable procedures to perfect and weaponize her magical control over metal... until she made a violent escape, killing many of her captors in the process. Now branded as a criminal, Rell attacks Noxian soldiers on sight as she searches for survivors of her old “academy”, defending the meek while delivering merciless death to her former instructors.\nBorn in Noxus , Rell's father was a military footsoldier while her mother was an heir to a now fallen noble house, causing Rell's childhood to lack the usual gilded upbringing that other noble children have in Noxus. Growing up into rough household, Rell started to vent her rage toward other children who mocked her, leading her to discover her love for fighting. Eventually, she decided to become a Reckoner with full supports of her parents as they saw it as profitable means of income for their poor financial situations. Overtime, she became a champion of the arena but all her earnings were wasted by her parents on expensive clothes and jewelries, which caused Rell to resent her parents overtime. Eventually, she caught the attention of the owner of the arena, Ambessa Merdada who saw her potential and offered to induct her into her warband. Her parents, especially her mother, wasted no time giving up their daughter to Ambessa in hope that they could gain influence within Noxian nobility by having the powerful House Merdada as their patron. Rell followed Ambessa willingly as she sicked of her parents constantly exploitation of her.\nAs she trained under Ambessa, Ambessa saw her as a potential heir in case Mel failed her and considered Rell as her adoptive daughter. During the battle against Ambessa's rebellious niece, Rell's rare and unique magical ability called ferromancy sparked and enabled her to defeat the enemy. Ambessa ordered her to kill her niece, which Rell complied. Seeing her potential, Ambessa decided to officially adopt her as a Merdarda and groom her to be her successor or at least being Mel's right-hand women to create a powerful sister duo for the glory of the Merdada clan. However, Lebanc kidnapped Rell under Ambessa's nose, causing Ambessa to lose her adoptive daughter.\nHer parents learned about their daughter's fate but Leblanc charmed them to let her exploit Rell in exchange for powers and influence. Once again, her parents sold off their daughter to the Black Rose, hoping the shadowy organization could earn them a place in Noxian government inner circle.\nRell was enrolled into the Roseguard Academy [ 1 ] , a boarding school for mages, hidden far away from the Noxian capital. Rell became the star pupil of her school and was visited by her parents on rare occasions, who expressed how proud they were of her. At the age of eight, Rell was forced into her first sparring match against one of her classmates, defeating him easily. While her sparring opponent was never seen again, the academy's staff painfully grafted a magical sigil onto Rell's skin, amplifying her magic. Rell trained within the academy for years and honed her skill in using her magic with martial combat, growing powerful with every sparring match she won and every sigil applied to Rell's skin. Overtime, most of the other students came to fear their turn to fight against her, with some even growing to hate her. One particular student, a boy named Gabriel who had the power to shape dirt into tiny fauna, actually befriended Rell and often comforted her as she recovered from the academy's abuse. Unfortunately, he would be instructed to combat against Rell next, forcing her to fight her only friend as he disappeared soon after, fueling her rage against the academy. [ 2 ]\nAfter a particularly barbaric duel on her sixteenth birthday, Rell became up with her mysteriously brutal training. She tore through the academy's guards and faculty to venture into a forbidden wing of the school, discovering the academy's horrifying truth-that her classmates had been Nullified . The students, now called Null, were emotionless, mindless husks that had their magic forcibly extracted from their bodies and turned into the same magic sigils that branded Rell's body. Rell then confronted the academy's headmistress only to discover that it was her own mother, who ensured that everything she did was for Rell's own sake.\nIn a fit of rage, Rell unleashed her full power and destroyed the school, ripping the building apart and using the metal to form her impenetrable suit of black armor. Bursting through the door with a lance and steed she constructed with her powers, she killed most of the staff and freed as many classmates as possible.\nA Noxian wanted poster calling for Rell's capture.\nMany classmates, including the Null children, fled after Rell's violent escape. In a bid to conceal the horrific acts that occurred within the academy, the Black Rose swiftly embarked on a mission to recapture the Null and eliminate any trace of the institution. Moreover, their utmost priority was the retrieval of their most valuable asset—Rell herself—who the Black Rose named a notorious fugitive and a threat to the empire. Plastered across Noxus, an array of wanted posters depicted Rell as a formidable criminal, with most Noxian soldiers seeing any mission to apprehend her as a death sentence. Promising substantial rewards to those capable of apprehending her, the posters advised individuals to deliver her to the nearest empire building marked with a signature Black Rose. [ 3 ]\nRell has emerged as a self-proclaimed defender of the meek and a violent insurgent, leading a relentless rebellion against both the Black Rose and the Noxian government. Because of the empire's willful disregard of the horrors that happened within the academy, she rides valiantly through the streets of Noxus atop her formidable iron steed and consumed with hatred against the entire nation. Her sole focus now is to dismantle the very foundations upon which Noxus stands and rescuing any survivors of the academy, most notably the Null.\nA warband in the outskirts of Noxus, lead by a former instructor of the academy named Instructor Lukas, managed to locate Rell and attempted to detain her. A minotaur soldier knocked Rell unconscious by tossing a boulder at her, but she woke up soon after and formed her metal steed from raw ore out of the ground. Rell easily killed the entire warband in a whirlwind of metallic shards and grabbed Lukas, who revealed that Gabriel, Rell's Nullified friend from the academy, was located at the nearby camp. Rell instantly crushed him to death and rode towards the camp to free Gabriel.\nRell standing above Gabriel's gravestone, which she decorated with crude metal statues of animals in his honor.\nUnfortunately, once at the hidden camp, Rell found Gabriel's malnourished corpse, as the Black Rose's warbands usually neglect the Null once they're detained. Pained by the discovery, Rell buried his body and created a gravestone out of metal, using her powers to decorate it with crude animal statues in his honor. [ 2 ]\nAt some point, a compound near the coastal settlement of Qualthala in the southern jungles managed to successfully detain Rell and at least one Null. Fortunately, Rell managed to escape by tearing her cell and the compound apart, leaving a mess of metallic shards and a hole leading into the jungles, presumably escaping alongside whatever Null was imprisoned there as well. [ 4 ]\nRell is a dark-skinned teenage girl with yellow eyes and bright blonde hair with some highlights of yellow. She typically wears a light suit of armor with leather pads on the shoulders, hips and knees. Her left hand has a torn arm sleeve with leather padding, while her right arm is sleeveless and covered in pieces of metal branding her with magical sigils. She wields her metal lance in her right hand and makes it glow a deep orange-yellow whenever she heats it up. Her mount is a metal construct shaped into the form of a horse thanks to her ferromancy magic.\nWhen Rell leaps off of her mount, she reshapes it into an even heavier set of metal armor that goes over her current outfit. Her heavy metal armor has a massive chest plate, knee guards, pieces of metal floating at the sides of her legs and a huge, spiked shoulder guard on her left shoulder.\nRell is impulsive, restless and aggressive. Her trauma at the Black Rose's academy, combined with her young age, has made her vengeful and misanthropic, having a distrustful attitude towards most people and feeling no hesitation to kill anyone that threatens her or whoever she's protecting. She feels pure hatred for the Black Rose and all of Noxus, blaming them for tall the atrocities she witnessed in the academy and expressing her hatred for everything about her nation, ranging from the politics to the people and even to the very land itself. In spite of this, she's very passionate about rescuing and protecting any of her surviving classmates from the academy, most notably the Null whom she feels deep guilt over. Though Rell struggles with connecting and socializing with most people due to her temper and distrust, she's shown to be capable of romantic feelings and has been easily flustered by both males and females she's attracted to.\nThe Black Rose were the organization that initially took Rell in to the Roseguard Academy under the guise of training her to be an elite in Noxus's army. However, Rell eventually realized the horrific truth of their experiments on her and the other classmates in the academy, such as their experimentation with sigil magic that turned most of Rell's classmates into the Null.\nRell has a deep hatred towards the Black Rose, and all of Noxus for that matter, because of what they did to her and her classmates within the academy. Now, as she rides across Noxus, she hunts down any remaining faculty that survived her escape and is set on brutally killing any of the Black Rose she manages to find. In response, the Black Rose have made many efforts to try and detain Rell, sending all manners of bounty hunters to capture her for their plans in stopping the menacing Mordekaiser .\nLeBlanc is the one who initially took notice to Rell's particular mastery with metal magic. After visiting Rell's parents, she offered a deal with them to take Rell into the academy and train her to be the Black Rose's living weapon, promising to make Rell an elite in the Noxian army and granting their noble house more political power in Noxus.\nThough she hasn't personally encountered Rell since her escape, she is most likely responsible for the many efforts to detain her.\nRell's father was a Noxian footsoldier while her mother was the heiress to a noble house that has since fallen from grace. Though technically nobles, Rell's family didn't enjoy the lavish lives that other members of the Noxian nobility would have due to their lowered political power, causing Rell to often be frustrated. Once she showed her magical talent in ferromancy, Rell's parents instantly saw an opportunity to return their noble house to greatness and convinced Rell to try and hone her magical abilities and eventually become an elite within the Noxian army. Though most of their apprenticeships failed, LeBlanc approached the couple and offered a deal to take her under the Black Rose academy, turning Rell into a living super weapon and in exchange granting their noble house more power. While Rell trained in the academy, her parents would seldom visit her but would always express how proud they were of their daughter despite the brutal treatment Rell faced while training in the academy.\nOnce Rell escaped on her sixteenth birthday, she discovered that the horrific experiments with the Null and sigil magic had been the orders of her own mother, who had been the headmistress of the academy this entire time. Now, Rell has a vicious hatred for her parents, but most particularly her mother, as she often mocks her mother's saying-\"excellence is measured in sacrifice.\"\nAll the Null are the product of the Black Rose's experiments with sigil magic, with each of them being a former classmate of Rell's that she was forced to fight. Once defeated, these kids would have their magic forcefully extracted from their bodies and placed into a sigil, branded into Rell's skin.\nBecause of the guilt she feels for the experiments and because she personally knew these Null kids in the past, Rell is dedicated to finding and freeing these Null before the Black Rose can detain and hide them away. One particular Null named Gabriel was a dear friend of Rell, but she unfortunately found him dead in an encampment on her quest to find and save him.\nRell and Samira have not met, but Samira is very aware of her due to the fact that she has gone on many missions to locate and detain Rell under the orders of her boss Captain Indari , who is secretly working alongside LeBlanc.\nMost recently, Samira was sent on a mission to retrieve Rell from containment in a compound near Qualthala , but had arrived too late as Rell already escaped alongside the Null. Despite this, Samira is incredibly intrigued by Rell, unaware of the truth behind Rell's origins.\nRell is completely unaware of Mordekaiser and has never met him, but her training with the Black Rose is the product of their plans to turn her into the perfect 'living weapon' to use against Mordekaiser as a contingency once he returns to the physical realm. This is most likely due to her particularly rare and powerful ability to manipulate metal, which is what Mordekaiser's physical, armored body is mostly made of."}

After visiting Rell's parents, she offered a deal with them to take Rell into the academy and train her to be the Black Rose's living weapon, promising to make Rell an elite in the Noxian army and granting their noble house more political power in Noxus.\nThough she hasn't personally encountered Rell since her escape, she is most likely responsible for the many efforts to detain her.\nRell's father was a Noxian footsoldier while her mother was the heiress to a noble house that has since fallen from grace. Though technically nobles, Rell's family didn't enjoy the lavish lives that other members of the Noxian nobility would have due to their lowered political power, causing Rell to often be frustrated. Once she showed her magical talent in ferromancy, Rell's parents instantly saw an opportunity to return their noble house to greatness and convinced Rell to try and hone her magical abilities and eventually become an elite within the Noxian army. Though most of their apprenticeships failed, LeBlanc approached the couple and offered a deal to take her under the Black Rose academy, turning Rell into a living super weapon and in exchange granting their noble house more power. While Rell trained in the academy, her parents would seldom visit her but would always express how proud they were of their daughter despite the brutal treatment Rell faced while training in the academy.\nOnce Rell escaped on her sixteenth birthday, she discovered that the horrific experiments with the Null and sigil magic had been the orders of her own mother, who had been the headmistress of the academy this entire time. Now, Rell has a vicious hatred for her parents, but most particularly her mother, as she often mocks her mother's saying-\"excellence is measured in sacrifice.\"\nAll the Null are the product of the Black Rose's experiments with sigil magic, with each of them being a former classmate of Rell's that she was forced to fight. Once defeated, these kids would have their magic forcefully extracted from their bodies and placed into a sigil, branded into Rell's skin.\nBecause of the guilt she feels for the experiments and because she personally knew these Null kids in the past, Rell is dedicated to finding and freeing these Null before the Black Rose can detain and hide them away. One particular Null named Gabriel was a dear friend of Rell, but she unfortunately found him dead in an encampment on her quest to find and save him.\nRell and Samira have not met, but Samira is very aware of her due to the fact that she has gone on many missions to locate and detain Rell under the orders of her boss Captain Indari , who is secretly working alongside LeBlanc.\nMost recently, Samira was sent on a mission to retrieve Rell from containment in a compound near Qualthala , but had arrived too late as Rell already escaped alongside the Null. Despite this, Samira is incredibly intrigued by Rell, unaware of the truth behind Rell's origins.\nRell is completely unaware of Mordekaiser and has never met him, but her training with the Black Rose is the product of their plans to turn her into the perfect 'living weapon' to use against Mordekaiser as a contingency once he returns to the physical realm. This is most likely due to her particularly rare and powerful ability to manipulate metal, which is what Mordekaiser's physical, armored body is mostly made of."}

Once, he was his empire's most esteemed warrior, leading the armies of Shurima to countless victories. However, after the empire's fall , Renekton was entombed beneath the sands, and slowly, as the world turned and changed, he succumbed to insanity. Now free once more, he is utterly consumed with finding and killing his brother, Nasus , who he blames, in his madness, for the centuries he spent in darkness.\nAs a child, Renekton was a fearless fighter, often engaging in street fights out of pride and enjoyment. Although his older brother Nasus disapproved of his behavior, Renekton continued to fight and fight, completely ignoring his brother's thoughts.\nLater on in life, when Nasus left to join the prestigious Collegium of the Sun, he concerned about his brother getting killed by the fights he constantly getting himself into with them grew bigger as days passed. Eventually, he was able to help him enter into the shuriman army, though he was underage.\nIn the army, Renekton found a new purpose and fought in numerous battles with the help of his brute strength and Nasus's strategic planning, including in the battle of Zuretta where he single handedly fought 1 to 10 and won, successfully held off until Nasus and his reinforcements intervened. He earned the title of Gatekeeper of Shurima after the act.\nAs he serves the army for many decades, he earned a reputation for himself, with the aiming to be stronger than any other living entities and even outpower the God-Warriors , but inside that battle-scarred body lies a caring heart and a place for his brother Nasus. When he learned of his brother's impending death due to a curse, he immediately rushed to The Sun Disc , where Nasus lay barely alive. To save his brother's life, Renekton carried him up the stairs of The Sun Disc, knowing that the process would likely obliterate him. Despite his unworthiness thoughts, Renekton's sacrifice led to the ascension of both brothers, with Renekton becoming a powerful crocodile.\nWith his new powers, Renekton continued to lead the Shuriman army to victory for centuries, becoming an unstoppable force topping the power of his old-self, following Shurima's footsteps in every victorious battle. Though as the centuries went on, many believe his mortality was lost when he stepped into the light.\nWhen Nashramae was captured and put under the law of Shurima, the crocodile beast went rampage and destroyed the grand library, completely annihilated it during the siege of the place. Nasus, hearing this, arrived at the scene to confront Renekton, causing his bloodlust dissipated under his brother's stern gaze and he turned away in shame.\nDuring the battle of Icathia , Renekton fought alongside Aatrox , Nasus , and several other Ascended beings. However, things took a turn for the worse when the Void was unleashed during the battle , inflicting the dangerous Voidborn upon them.\nAround the same time, Azir 's ascension was sabotaged by Xerath , who killed him and stole his power. When the brothers learned of this, they hurried back to the capital. However, upon their return a few days later, Xerath had absorbed so much energy that he had become nothing but solid energy himself, making him the most dangerous [1] Baccai ever unleashed.\nIn an effort to contain Xerath's power, the brothers managed to trap him within a sarcophagus but it wasn't easy-Xerath retaliates; it took a while for the duos to force him down the tomb of the empire's. Renekton then ordered Nasus to seal the tomb, knowing that he himself would be trapped there with Xerath for eternity. With a heavy heart, Nasus carried out Renekton's order and sealed the tomb, leaving the two trapped in the darkness forever.\nTrapped within the tomb, Renekton continued to battle Xerath in the darkness. However, as centuries passed, the isolation and the unending battle took a toll on Renekton's mind and willpower, causing him to slowly lose his grip on sanity. Xerath, taking advantage of Renekton's weakened state, began to poison his mind and twist his thoughts.\nRenekton soon became convinced that Nasus, his own brother, had been jealous of his power and had taken pleasure in locking him in the tomb with Xerath. This delusion only served to fuel Renekton's anger and despair, leading him to lash out at Nasus whenever he thought of him.\nIn the year 989 AN, Sivir , a treasure hunter hired by Cassiopeia , ventured into the tomb in search of riches. However, Cassiopeia betrayed Sivir and inadvertently released both Renekton and Xerath from their imprisonment.\nUpon his release, Renekton, driven by the scent of his brother, immediately set out to find Nasus. However, he soon discovered that the world he knew eons ago had changed drastically, as he now wandered a desert landscape vastly different from the one he remembered. He wandered across the familiar scorching desert of Shurima he once known, and continued his search with a single-minded focus.\nAs Renekton searched the desert for his brother, he stumbled upon a group of sandtrawlers led by Sai-Surtha's. Upon discovering the group's latest victim, Uksem Heartsplitter, Renekton demanded to know the whereabouts of his brother. Instead of answering his question, Sai-Surtha's challenged Renekton to a duel.\nEven when being haunted by memories of Xerath's power, Renekton emerged victorious from the battle, though he was sliced into pieces before re-forging himself and throwing the sandtrawler's body into the jaws of a nearby predator. Turning his attention to the remaining members of the group, Renekton confronted Raz Bloodmane , who suggested that Nasus might be found near the cliffs of Azuma.\nChoosing to spare Raz's life, Renekton left the group behind and continued his search for Nasus.\n*warning, the next section is based on information found within LOR, take this section with a grain of salt.*\nWhile searching for Nasus, Renekton encountered a sand runner who had been sent by Azir to collect a medallion from the Sandthrasher's cavern. Cornering the runner near a sand spire after escaping the Bloodthirsty Marauder , Renekton attempted to take the medallion, but the runner managed to escape by dodging Renekton's axe and triggering a cave-in.\nLater on, Renekton joined forces with the Sandthrashers and found a tower where Nasus was being held. However, upon seeing his brother, Renekton was consumed by the poison thoughts that Xerath had implanted in his mind eons ago.

Once, he was his empire's most esteemed warrior, leading the armies of Shurima to countless victories. However, after the empire's fall , Renekton was entombed beneath the sands, and slowly, as the world turned and changed, he succumbed to insanity. Now free once more, he is utterly consumed with finding and killing his brother, Nasus , who he blames, in his madness, for the centuries he spent in darkness.\nAs a child, Renekton was a fearless fighter, often engaging in street fights out of pride and enjoyment. Although his older brother Nasus disapproved of his behavior, Renekton continued to fight and fight, completely ignoring his brother's thoughts.\nLater on in life, when Nasus left to join the prestigious Collegium of the Sun, he concerned about his brother getting killed by the fights he constantly getting himself into with them grew bigger as days passed. Eventually, he was able to help him enter into the shuriman army, though he was underage.\nIn the army, Renekton found a new purpose and fought in numerous battles with the help of his brute strength and Nasus's strategic planning, including in the battle of Zuretta where he single handedly fought 1 to 10 and won, successfully held off until Nasus and his reinforcements intervened. He earned the title of Gatekeeper of Shurima after the act.\nAs he serves the army for many decades, he earned a reputation for himself, with the aiming to be stronger than any other living entities and even outpower the God-Warriors , but inside that battle-scarred body lies a caring heart and a place for his brother Nasus. When he learned of his brother's impending death due to a curse, he immediately rushed to The Sun Disc , where Nasus lay barely alive. To save his brother's life, Renekton carried him up the stairs of The Sun Disc, knowing that the process would likely obliterate him. Despite his unworthiness thoughts, Renekton's sacrifice led to the ascension of both brothers, with Renekton becoming a powerful crocodile.\nWith his new powers, Renekton continued to lead the Shuriman army to victory for centuries, becoming an unstoppable force topping the power of his old-self, following Shurima's footsteps in every victorious battle. Though as the centuries went on, many believe his mortality was lost when he stepped into the light.\nWhen Nashramae was captured and put under the law of Shurima, the crocodile beast went rampage and destroyed the grand library, completely annihilated it during the siege of the place. Nasus, hearing this, arrived at the scene to confront Renekton, causing his bloodlust dissipated under his brother's stern gaze and he turned away in shame.\nDuring the battle of Icathia , Renekton fought alongside Aatrox , Nasus , and several other Ascended beings. However, things took a turn for the worse when the Void was unleashed during the battle , inflicting the dangerous Voidborn upon them.\nAround the same time, Azir 's ascension was sabotaged by Xerath , who killed him and stole his power. When the brothers learned of this, they hurried back to the capital. However, upon their return a few days later, Xerath had absorbed so much energy that he had become nothing but solid energy himself, making him the most dangerous [1] Baccai ever unleashed.\nIn an effort to contain Xerath's power, the brothers managed to trap him within a sarcophagus but it wasn't easy-Xerath retaliates; it took a while for the duos to force him down the tomb of the empire's. Renekton then ordered Nasus to seal the tomb, knowing that he himself would be trapped there with Xerath for eternity. With a heavy heart, Nasus carried out Renekton's order and sealed the tomb, leaving the two trapped in the darkness forever.\nTrapped within the tomb, Renekton continued to battle Xerath in the darkness. However, as centuries passed, the isolation and the unending battle took a toll on Renekton's mind and willpower, causing him to slowly lose his grip on sanity. Xerath, taking advantage of Renekton's weakened state, began to poison his mind and twist his thoughts.\nRenekton soon became convinced that Nasus, his own brother, had been jealous of his power and had taken pleasure in locking him in the tomb with Xerath. This delusion only served to fuel Renekton's anger and despair, leading him to lash out at Nasus whenever he thought of him.\nIn the year 989 AN, Sivir , a treasure hunter hired by Cassiopeia , ventured into the tomb in search of riches. However, Cassiopeia betrayed Sivir and inadvertently released both Renekton and Xerath from their imprisonment.\nUpon his release, Renekton, driven by the scent of his brother, immediately set out to find Nasus. However, he soon discovered that the world he knew eons ago had changed drastically, as he now wandered a desert landscape vastly different from the one he remembered. He wandered across the familiar scorching desert of Shurima he once known, and continued his search with a single-minded focus.\nAs Renekton searched the desert for his brother, he stumbled upon a group of sandtrawlers led by Sai-Surtha's. Upon discovering the group's latest victim, Uksem Heartsplitter, Renekton demanded to know the whereabouts of his brother. Instead of answering his question, Sai-Surtha's challenged Renekton to a duel.\nEven when being haunted by memories of Xerath's power, Renekton emerged victorious from the battle, though he was sliced into pieces before re-forging himself and throwing the sandtrawler's body into the jaws of a nearby predator. Turning his attention to the remaining members of the group, Renekton confronted Raz Bloodmane , who suggested that Nasus might be found near the cliffs of Azuma.\nChoosing to spare Raz's life, Renekton left the group behind and continued his search for Nasus.\n*warning, the next section is based on information found within LOR, take this section with a grain of salt.*\nWhile searching for Nasus, Renekton encountered a sand runner who had been sent by Azir to collect a medallion from the Sandthrasher's cavern. Cornering the runner near a sand spire after escaping the Bloodthirsty Marauder , Renekton attempted to take the medallion, but the runner managed to escape by dodging Renekton's axe and triggering a cave-in.\nLater on, Renekton joined forces with the Sandthrashers and found a tower where Nasus was being held. However, upon seeing his brother, Renekton was consumed by the poison thoughts that Xerath had implanted in his mind eons ago. He crashed into the wall and found himself in the Chamber of Renewal with both Nasus and the sand runner from earlier.\nIn a fit of rage, Renekton attacked Nasus, allowing the scout to use the portal that Nasus had just gone through to escape. As the battle between the two brothers continued, they both grew to gigantic size, towering over everyone else.

He scours the world for the most fearsome beasts he can find, especially seeking any trace of Kha'Zix , the void creature who scratched out his eye. Rengar stalks his prey neither for food nor glory, but for the sheer beauty of the pursuit.\nRengar hails from a tribe of Shuriman vastaya known as the Kiilash, whose society venerated the honor and glory of the hunt. Rengar was born the runt of the litter to the tribe's chieftain, Ponjaf. Ponjaf believed Rengar's diminutive size would make him a worthless hunter. He ignored his child, assuming the runt would starve to death.\nEventually, the young Rengar fled the camp, ashamed that he had disappointed his father. He subsisted on grubs and plants for weeks until, one day, he was nearly killed by a legendary human hunter named Markon. Upon seeing Rengar's state, he took pity on the creature and let it live. Besides, this was no mighty vastayan warrior worthy of Markon's blade.\nRengar spent months following Markon, feeding off the corpses the hunter left behind. He still hoped to one day rejoin his tribe, and so took great care in observing how Markon took down his quarries.\nAfter some time, Markon grew sick of the pathetic Kiilash following him around. He put a knife to Rengar's throat and informed him that the only way to be a hunter was to hunt. He tossed Rengar the blade and kicked him down a ravine, where he was forced to make his first kill to survive.\nFrom then on, Rengar spent years pushing himself almost to breaking point. He scoured Shurima for the most powerful and dangerous prey. Though he would never be as big as other Kiilash, Rengar was determined to be twice as ferocious. Over time, instead of coming back to his camp each time with fresh scars, he began to come back with trophies. He polished a sandhawk's skull to a sheen; he braided the teeth of a shrieker into his hair.\nThen, when he decided the time had come, Rengar returned to his tribe, ready to be accepted as a true hunter.\nPonjaf scoffed at Rengar and his trophies. He decreed that only by bringing back the head of the elusive and legendary Void-abomination known as Kha'Zix would Rengar be welcomed back into the tribe.\nBlinded by his eagerness, Rengar allowed this cunning beast to get the drop on him. The Void creature ripped out one of Rengar's eyes and escaped. Furious and defeated, Rengar admitted his failure to Ponjaf. As expected, his father chastised him.\nBut as Ponjaf spoke, Rengar noticed all the trophies adorning his father's hut were dusty and old. The chieftain had not hunted anything in a long time—he had likely sent Rengar after Kha'Zix because he was too afraid to do it himself.\nRengar interrupted his father and called him a coward. Many Kiilash were blessed with strong bodies or comfortable homes. Rengar, conversely, was born facing death. He had taught himself how to hunt, and had the trophies and scars to prove it. Even his own bloody eye socket was a trophy: proof that though Rengar was born with disadvantages, he never gave up.\nRengar leapt onto his father and gutted him from neck to belly. The fiercest hunters of the tribe crowned him with flame-roses, marking him as their new chieftain.\nBut Rengar didn't need his village's acceptance. All he needed was adrenaline pumping through his veins as he chased down his prey. He left the village, without even pausing to take a trophy from what was left of Ponjaf—his father was not a kill worthy of remembering. Instead, he set off determined to find and slay the Void creature that had tried to blind him.\nNot to satisfy the Kiilash, but to satisfy himself.\n(TBA)\n(TBA)\nRengar's as fierce as they come as well as brave, he lives for the hunt and the thrill of it and he roams the land seeking worthy opponents or prey that can put up a fight, those he kills, he puts on display in his trophy collection. but while he is savage he is incredibly intelligent, much to that of a patient predator, he studies his prey for strengths and weaknesses and then start hunting.\nHaving fought and lost an eye as well as almost his life, Rengar sees Kha'Zix as the ultimate prey and wants to hunt him down and mount his head on his den as the ultimate hunting trophy .\nRengar was saved by Lucian and a Sentinel Rookie when the Sentinels of Light came to the jungles Ixtal in search of a fetter, he would later join them in order to hunt Viego to prove that he was still an apex predator."}

He scours the world for the most fearsome beasts he can find, especially seeking any trace of Kha'Zix , the void creature who scratched out his eye. Rengar stalks his prey neither for food nor glory, but for the sheer beauty of the pursuit.\nRengar hails from a tribe of Shuriman vastaya known as the Kiilash, whose society venerated the honor and glory of the hunt. Rengar was born the runt of the litter to the tribe's chieftain, Ponjaf. Ponjaf believed Rengar's diminutive size would make him a worthless hunter. He ignored his child, assuming the runt would starve to death.\nEventually, the young Rengar fled the camp, ashamed that he had disappointed his father. He subsisted on grubs and plants for weeks until, one day, he was nearly killed by a legendary human hunter named Markon. Upon seeing Rengar's state, he took pity on the creature and let it live. Besides, this was no mighty vastayan warrior worthy of Markon's blade.\nRengar spent months following Markon, feeding off the corpses the hunter left behind. He still hoped to one day rejoin his tribe, and so took great care in observing how Markon took down his quarries.\nAfter some time, Markon grew sick of the pathetic Kiilash following him around. He put a knife to Rengar's throat and informed him that the only way to be a hunter was to hunt. He tossed Rengar the blade and kicked him down a ravine, where he was forced to make his first kill to survive.\nFrom then on, Rengar spent years pushing himself almost to breaking point. He scoured Shurima for the most powerful and dangerous prey. Though he would never be as big as other Kiilash, Rengar was determined to be twice as ferocious. Over time, instead of coming back to his camp each time with fresh scars, he began to come back with trophies. He polished a sandhawk's skull to a sheen; he braided the teeth of a shrieker into his hair.\nThen, when he decided the time had come, Rengar returned to his tribe, ready to be accepted as a true hunter.\nPonjaf scoffed at Rengar and his trophies. He decreed that only by bringing back the head of the elusive and legendary Void-abomination known as Kha'Zix would Rengar be welcomed back into the tribe.\nBlinded by his eagerness, Rengar allowed this cunning beast to get the drop on him. The Void creature ripped out one of Rengar's eyes and escaped. Furious and defeated, Rengar admitted his failure to Ponjaf. As expected, his father chastised him.\nBut as Ponjaf spoke, Rengar noticed all the trophies adorning his father's hut were dusty and old. The chieftain had not hunted anything in a long time—he had likely sent Rengar after Kha'Zix because he was too afraid to do it himself.\nRengar interrupted his father and called him a coward. Many Kiilash were blessed with strong bodies or comfortable homes. Rengar, conversely, was born facing death. He had taught himself how to hunt, and had the trophies and scars to prove it. Even his own bloody eye socket was a trophy: proof that though Rengar was born with disadvantages, he never gave up.\nRengar leapt onto his father and gutted him from neck to belly. The fiercest hunters of the tribe crowned him with flame-roses, marking him as their new chieftain.\nBut Rengar didn't need his village's acceptance. All he needed was adrenaline pumping through his veins as he chased down his prey. He left the village, without even pausing to take a trophy from what was left of Ponjaf—his father was not a kill worthy of remembering. Instead, he set off determined to find and slay the Void creature that had tried to blind him.\nNot to satisfy the Kiilash, but to satisfy himself.\n(TBA)\n(TBA)\nRengar's as fierce as they come as well as brave, he lives for the hunt and the thrill of it and he roams the land seeking worthy opponents or prey that can put up a fight, those he kills, he puts on display in his trophy collection. but while he is savage he is incredibly intelligent, much to that of a patient predator, he studies his prey for strengths and weaknesses and then start hunting.\nHaving fought and lost an eye as well as almost his life, Rengar sees Kha'Zix as the ultimate prey and wants to hunt him down and mount his head on his den as the ultimate hunting trophy .\nRengar was saved by Lucian and a Sentinel Rookie when the Sentinels of Light came to the jungles Ixtal in search of a fetter, he would later join them in order to hunt Viego to prove that he was still an apex predator."}

However, on the Ionian front, Riven's faith in her nation was tested and ultimately broken. She severed all ties to the empire, seeking to find her place in a shattered world, even as rumors abounded that Noxus had been reforged. Now forced to return in chains, she faces the judgment of her former homeland...\nRiven was born on a farm in the coastal farming village of Trevale , in Noxus . Her father had been a soldier, slain in battle and her own mother was said to not survived the birth, leaving young Riven to work the farms as an orphan. Working a farm wasn't her lifelong goal, however. She longed for more. Inspired by warband conscriptors that would frequent Trevale, she would eventually join the Fury Company and pledge her strength to the Noxian Empire. Alongside her sisters- and brothers- in arms, whose bonds were forged in the heat of battle, a bond she saw as unbreakable, Riven thrived.\nDespite her youth, Riven proved to be a natural soldier. Years of working at the farm made her strong, and in turn, allow her to master the weight of a longsword so much taller and heavier than herself. So strong was her dedication, that it got her noticed by Boram Darkwill , the emperor of Noxus, who bestowed Riven her own massive runic blade, said to be enchanted by a certain pale sorceress in his court.\nNot long after, Riven and her warband would sail for Ionia, intended to take part of the long planned Noxus-led occupation. The war dragged, and it became clear that Ionia would not kneel. Fury Company was eventually assigned to escort another warband, through the embattled Navori Province. The warband's leader, a commander by the name of Emystan, had just commissioned weapons from a Zaunite alchymist, and was eager to test them out. Riven had been glad to put her life on the Altar of the Noxian Empire across countless campaigns, but the something had been off about this one. The soldiers, the weapons' purpose, something was off. It made Riven uneasy.\nThis campaign, much like the others, was met with strong resistance. It was the land itself fighting back. Stranded on a muddy landslide during a rainstorm, the Ionian resistance saw an opportunity. Seeing the opposition, Riven called Emystan for backup. It would be the last Captain Riven would ever do.\nA flaming arrow, flown from the ridgeside, embedded itself into the wagon. Riven had instinctively drawn her sword, but it wasn't enough to protect anyone but herself. Chemical flames burst from the wagon, engulfing Noxian and Ionian alike, leaving them to suffer a slow agonizing death. Saved from the toxic mist by the magic in her Runeblade,  Riven could only watch in horror as both family and foe slowly choked to death on the poisonous fumes. There she realized the high cost of the war bent not on expanding Noxus's borders or spreading its ideals, but one of complete and utter annihilation. One of complete utter betrayal and atrocity.\nMemories of the event would only come to Riven later in nightmares, but the impact was enough. Disgusted with the betrayal, Riven had come to hate the blade that saved her life, her final tie to Noxus. Seeking the assistance of a windblade master, Riven would have it shattered, but even that failed to bring her peace. She wandered the Ionian countryside, deciding exile was a better price for someone who'd wrought as much damage as she.\nEventually, her travels would return her to the village where she'd broken the sword. There, she would be taken in by a pair of Ionian farmers, distraught over the loss of their own sons, but unwilling to live in the past and fully ready to embrace the future. Once she'd regain her health, Riven would help them in the fields until one day Ionian soldiers came for her. Then, she learned that the master she'd sought help for to destroy her blade had perished, and that in seeing her blade, the Ionian soldiers have new evidence as to who might have done it.\nNow dragged to court, Riven faced trail for the murder of Elder Souma, whom she currently had no true recollection of ever meeting. After being bombarded with questions, Riven's blade, the Runesword she had sought to destroy and now laid in pieces sans one, was brought out. The final piece, found embedded in the corpse of Elder Souma, was slotted back into the weapon and revived the deactivated weapon and her memories. Riven was in fact, she revealed, the one who killed Elder Souma.\nThat night she was made to stay in the trail room, to await her sentence. A hooded man, who'd had approached her the day before prior to her arrest, came to her. There, he revealed himself to be Yasuo , Elder Souma's apprentice, who'd been tasked to guard the elder but had left to fight in the Noxian Invasion . He'd return to his village to his master dead, his village attacked, and first and foremost had been accused of Souma's murder. Now seeking vengeance, he challenged Riven to a fight, to which she agreed.\nThe battle was on then.\nOnly stopping when Riven's Runic blade, activated but still very much in pieces, slid and a piece shot out, the piece flying in the direction of Riven's adoptive father, Asa Konte, who'd had come to Riven to free her from her chains. It would've killed him were it not for Yasuo's windwall, stopping right as it was about to embed itself onto the old man's neck. There it was where Riven understood, that they both could not escape their pasts, but can embrace change. When the magistrate returned, Riven was ready to face her sentence. The council, seeing as no longer wishing for additional bloodshed, had sentenced her to years of servitude in the farms around the village, starting that of the Kontes. Riven, now reforged somewhat, agreed.\nIn the later years, Riven was caught and she was forced to fight as a Reckoning in the Reckoner’s Arena, which is run by Darius’s brother, Draven. She later helped Lucian, Senna, and Vayne escape during the harrowing in Noxus and temporarily joined the Sentinels of Light to atone for her sins. Her whereabouts after the events of the Sentinels of Light were unknown, presumably returning to the Kontes’ farm.\nShe was ruthless and efficient as a warrior, but her true strength lay in her conviction. She entered battles without any trace of doubt in her mind: no ethical pause, no fear of death. She is a determined and fiercely devoted individual with internal discipline.\nRiven is a tall  woman with an athletic build, tanned skin, dark golden eyes, and platinum white hair tied up in a bow.\nShe usually wears a two-part white dress, as well as bandages on her right arm and she has parts of black armor that covers her shoulder, left leg, and a metal glove on her left hand.\nRiven was a Noxian soldier sent to Ionia during the empire's invasion. A traumatic experience during the campaign involving Singed's chemicals caused her to question her devotion and sever her ties to Noxus, wandering ever since. Singed was approached by a Noxian military commander named Emystan, who Riven's unit was assigned to escort, to help her break the bitter stalemate of the war in Ionia . When Riven called to Emystan for support during a battle, both sides were annihilated by the chemicals he created. Seeing the approval of slaughter of the innocent caused by Singed and Emystan also made Quilletta Varn grew more disillusioned by the empire's ambitions, which led to her rebel against the empire and the events of Darius' comic Blood of Noxus .\nYasuo suspected Riven of being the one who killed Elder Souma, whom Yasuo was supposed to protect ( \"Wait, that technique ... huh\" , \"Huh, three swift strikes... \" , \"Another wind blade?\" , \"Who taught you that ?\" ) Riven eventually confessed to unintentionally killing Elder Souma: desperate to erase her past as a Noxian invader and killer, Riven begged the elderly wind -master to shatter her runic blade, which was the past's memento. Souma succeeded, yet a stray shard struck his neck, killing him.\nThe confession absolved Yasuo of murder, yet not of his personal guilt of abandoning his post that led to Souma's accidental death and him having to kill multiple brethen in self-defense, including his own brother . Yasuo's presence or absence making a difference was highlighted during Riven's trial, when he focused the Wind Technique on Riven's sword as Souma would have, and the shard that killed his master nearly did the same to Asa Konte, Riven's adopted father. This time, Yasuo was able to stop the shard before it could cause any harm.\nHer blade was enchanted by LeBlanc , who is seemingly trying to take it back.\nRiven's sisters in war Arrel , Marit and Teneff were tasked with and succeeded in bringing her back to Noxus , where she was sentenced to life in the Fleshing Arena . The group leader, Tifalenji , was sent by LeBlanc to retrieve the blade. She was angry when she found out it was broken (and LeBlanc will possibly be, too).\nDraven finds her a worthy opponent when she was forced to fight in his arena.\nRiven helped the Sentinels of Light escape from Reckoner's Arena and would later join them in their fight against Viego's Ruination. Riven was initially rebuked by Irelia , due to her past actions during the Noxian Invasion, but eventually gained her respect during their time together as Sentinels of Light."}

There, she would be taken in by a pair of Ionian farmers, distraught over the loss of their own sons, but unwilling to live in the past and fully ready to embrace the future. Once she'd regain her health, Riven would help them in the fields until one day Ionian soldiers came for her. Then, she learned that the master she'd sought help for to destroy her blade had perished, and that in seeing her blade, the Ionian soldiers have new evidence as to who might have done it.\nNow dragged to court, Riven faced trail for the murder of Elder Souma, whom she currently had no true recollection of ever meeting. After being bombarded with questions, Riven's blade, the Runesword she had sought to destroy and now laid in pieces sans one, was brought out. The final piece, found embedded in the corpse of Elder Souma, was slotted back into the weapon and revived the deactivated weapon and her memories. Riven was in fact, she revealed, the one who killed Elder Souma.\nThat night she was made to stay in the trail room, to await her sentence. A hooded man, who'd had approached her the day before prior to her arrest, came to her. There, he revealed himself to be Yasuo , Elder Souma's apprentice, who'd been tasked to guard the elder but had left to fight in the Noxian Invasion . He'd return to his village to his master dead, his village attacked, and first and foremost had been accused of Souma's murder. Now seeking vengeance, he challenged Riven to a fight, to which she agreed.\nThe battle was on then.\nOnly stopping when Riven's Runic blade, activated but still very much in pieces, slid and a piece shot out, the piece flying in the direction of Riven's adoptive father, Asa Konte, who'd had come to Riven to free her from her chains. It would've killed him were it not for Yasuo's windwall, stopping right as it was about to embed itself onto the old man's neck. There it was where Riven understood, that they both could not escape their pasts, but can embrace change. When the magistrate returned, Riven was ready to face her sentence. The council, seeing as no longer wishing for additional bloodshed, had sentenced her to years of servitude in the farms around the village, starting that of the Kontes. Riven, now reforged somewhat, agreed.\nIn the later years, Riven was caught and she was forced to fight as a Reckoning in the Reckoner’s Arena, which is run by Darius’s brother, Draven. She later helped Lucian, Senna, and Vayne escape during the harrowing in Noxus and temporarily joined the Sentinels of Light to atone for her sins. Her whereabouts after the events of the Sentinels of Light were unknown, presumably returning to the Kontes’ farm.\nShe was ruthless and efficient as a warrior, but her true strength lay in her conviction. She entered battles without any trace of doubt in her mind: no ethical pause, no fear of death. She is a determined and fiercely devoted individual with internal discipline.\nRiven is a tall  woman with an athletic build, tanned skin, dark golden eyes, and platinum white hair tied up in a bow.\nShe usually wears a two-part white dress, as well as bandages on her right arm and she has parts of black armor that covers her shoulder, left leg, and a metal glove on her left hand.\nRiven was a Noxian soldier sent to Ionia during the empire's invasion. A traumatic experience during the campaign involving Singed's chemicals caused her to question her devotion and sever her ties to Noxus, wandering ever since. Singed was approached by a Noxian military commander named Emystan, who Riven's unit was assigned to escort, to help her break the bitter stalemate of the war in Ionia . When Riven called to Emystan for support during a battle, both sides were annihilated by the chemicals he created. Seeing the approval of slaughter of the innocent caused by Singed and Emystan also made Quilletta Varn grew more disillusioned by the empire's ambitions, which led to her rebel against the empire and the events of Darius' comic Blood of Noxus .\nYasuo suspected Riven of being the one who killed Elder Souma, whom Yasuo was supposed to protect ( \"Wait, that technique ... huh\" , \"Huh, three swift strikes... \" , \"Another wind blade?\" , \"Who taught you that ?\" ) Riven eventually confessed to unintentionally killing Elder Souma: desperate to erase her past as a Noxian invader and killer, Riven begged the elderly wind -master to shatter her runic blade, which was the past's memento. Souma succeeded, yet a stray shard struck his neck, killing him.\nThe confession absolved Yasuo of murder, yet not of his personal guilt of abandoning his post that led to Souma's accidental death and him having to kill multiple brethen in self-defense, including his own brother . Yasuo's presence or absence making a difference was highlighted during Riven's trial, when he focused the Wind Technique on Riven's sword as Souma would have, and the shard that killed his master nearly did the same to Asa Konte, Riven's adopted father. This time, Yasuo was able to stop the shard before it could cause any harm.\nHer blade was enchanted by LeBlanc , who is seemingly trying to take it back.\nRiven's sisters in war Arrel , Marit and Teneff were tasked with and succeeded in bringing her back to Noxus , where she was sentenced to life in the Fleshing Arena . The group leader, Tifalenji , was sent by LeBlanc to retrieve the blade. She was angry when she found out it was broken (and LeBlanc will possibly be, too).\nDraven finds her a worthy opponent when she was forced to fight in his arena.\nRiven helped the Sentinels of Light escape from Reckoner's Arena and would later join them in their fight against Viego's Ruination. Riven was initially rebuked by Irelia , due to her past actions during the Noxian Invasion, but eventually gained her respect during their time together as Sentinels of Light."}

Armed with immense arcane power and a boundless constitution, he tirelessly hunts for World Runes — fragments of the raw magic that once shaped the world from nothingness. He must retrieve these artifacts before they fall into the wrong hands, for Ryze understands the horrors they could unleash on Runeterra.\nBorn in Noxii terratories which would later become Noxus , in the village of Khom , Ryze was a young mage apprentice to Master Tyrus of Helia , a member of a order tasked with gathering and protecting the most dangerous artifacts of Runeterra .\nAs time passed, Ryze would sometimes overhear Tyrus discussing something known as a World Rune , a collection of shards that held unbelievable power, but would hush himself if Tyrus ever spotted Ryze listening in. Though Tyrus tried his best to keep it hidden, word eventually got out about the World Runes and paranoia started to spread throughout Runeterra over how these World Runes could be used as weapons. Tyrus and Ryze travelled around Valoran trying to calm people down but the situation only grew more dire. Eventually though, the first shot was fired in what would later be known as the Rune Wars , in Noxii, Ryze's old home. Tyrus and Ryze tried and failed to hold a parley in Khom, but had no choice but to flee to the hills and when they looked back to Khom, nothing remained of Ryze's birthplace but a giant hole.\nWar raged across Runeterra, Ryze wanted to pick a side and help but Tyrus stopped him, Tyrus wanted to guide the world back towards peace, not bring it further into ruin. But the Rune Wars kept going, and Tyrus grew more and more distant. Eventually it got to a point where Ryze had to confront Tyrus, where he noticed Tyrus had come into possesion of two World Runes. A big argument insued, Tyrus argued that he needed the World Runes to stop the people, that there was no other way to stop the war. Ryze no longer saw Tyrus as his mentor, he was now just another man fallen to the temptation of the World Runes, and so Ryze mustered all the magic he was able to and 2 killed him .\nSoon after, the Rune Wars ended, with the greatest civilizations all but having destroyed eachother. Ryze realised that as long as any World Runes were unsecured, this could happen again. He decided then that he alone would take on the burden of gathering all the World Runes and storing them away for good, vowing never to fall into temptation like his old master Tyrus.\nA battle raged in Shurima , between the darkin Aatrox and Xolaani , one which threatened to end all of Runeterra. As Ryze traveled, a 3 winged being appreared from the skies with a plea for help, Ryze recognized the messenger and realised it could only have come from Kayle herself. Kayle's mother and the Aspect of Justice, Mihira , had descended from the heavens to join the fight, but had fallen to Xolaani and been 7 absorbed . As Ryze arrived at the battle, Kayle explained that Ryze alone had the power to stop the battle, by using the World Runes. Ryze hesitated, unsure wether it was right for him to act and with the World Runes no less. Ryze meditated on the history of Runeterra and ultimately came to the conclusion that Runeterra was worthy to be saved, and activated the World Runes, defeating Aatrox and Xolaani.\nRyze is a old man with violet skin due to prolonged contact with the World Runes. His body is full of tattoos in runic styles. He is bald but has a scrappy black beard, tied togheter at the end with a hair ring. Ryze is shirtless except for a a leather shoulderguard with a sash holding it togheter. A giant scroll is attached to his back, held there by the leather sash. He wears fairly detailess, loose, dark blue pants with high leather boots. Around his waist he wears a leather belt with a book tied to it.\nRyze has become tired, longing for the day when all of this is over. Always in a hurry to get anything done as fast as possible. He tends to come across as quite rude, though argues its becouse he has better things to be doing. Though he is tired, he is steadfast in his goal and will get it done no matter what cost, even if that cost is the life of his friend or the death of a village. Their deaths are nothing compared to what the World Runes could bring.  Ryze has a strong control over his emotions, though he often gets mad, he never loses himself in an emotion. The only emotion he cannot control is hope, an emotion he tries desperately to get rid off, but always manages to influence him.\nKegan Rodhe, as he was known before he became Brand, was previously Ryze's apprentice, saved by Ryze from freezing to death in the harsh Freljordian cold. Ryze saw potential in Kegan and attempted to teach him to control his latent magical abilites. Kegan and Ryze both often became frustrated with eachother, but still held compassion for eachother.\nThough as Ryze neared the true goal of his journey, to one of the World Runes, Kegan fell to the temptation of the World Rune and Ryze was too late to stop him. Kegan's body and soul was burned away by the World Rune's power and what was left was the entity known as Brand.

Armed with immense arcane power and a boundless constitution, he tirelessly hunts for World Runes — fragments of the raw magic that once shaped the world from nothingness. He must retrieve these artifacts before they fall into the wrong hands, for Ryze understands the horrors they could unleash on Runeterra.\nBorn in Noxii terratories which would later become Noxus , in the village of Khom , Ryze was a young mage apprentice to Master Tyrus of Helia , a member of a order tasked with gathering and protecting the most dangerous artifacts of Runeterra .\nAs time passed, Ryze would sometimes overhear Tyrus discussing something known as a World Rune , a collection of shards that held unbelievable power, but would hush himself if Tyrus ever spotted Ryze listening in. Though Tyrus tried his best to keep it hidden, word eventually got out about the World Runes and paranoia started to spread throughout Runeterra over how these World Runes could be used as weapons. Tyrus and Ryze travelled around Valoran trying to calm people down but the situation only grew more dire. Eventually though, the first shot was fired in what would later be known as the Rune Wars , in Noxii, Ryze's old home. Tyrus and Ryze tried and failed to hold a parley in Khom, but had no choice but to flee to the hills and when they looked back to Khom, nothing remained of Ryze's birthplace but a giant hole.\nWar raged across Runeterra, Ryze wanted to pick a side and help but Tyrus stopped him, Tyrus wanted to guide the world back towards peace, not bring it further into ruin. But the Rune Wars kept going, and Tyrus grew more and more distant. Eventually it got to a point where Ryze had to confront Tyrus, where he noticed Tyrus had come into possesion of two World Runes. A big argument insued, Tyrus argued that he needed the World Runes to stop the people, that there was no other way to stop the war. Ryze no longer saw Tyrus as his mentor, he was now just another man fallen to the temptation of the World Runes, and so Ryze mustered all the magic he was able to and 2 killed him .\nSoon after, the Rune Wars ended, with the greatest civilizations all but having destroyed eachother. Ryze realised that as long as any World Runes were unsecured, this could happen again. He decided then that he alone would take on the burden of gathering all the World Runes and storing them away for good, vowing never to fall into temptation like his old master Tyrus.\nA battle raged in Shurima , between the darkin Aatrox and Xolaani , one which threatened to end all of Runeterra. As Ryze traveled, a 3 winged being appreared from the skies with a plea for help, Ryze recognized the messenger and realised it could only have come from Kayle herself. Kayle's mother and the Aspect of Justice, Mihira , had descended from the heavens to join the fight, but had fallen to Xolaani and been 7 absorbed . As Ryze arrived at the battle, Kayle explained that Ryze alone had the power to stop the battle, by using the World Runes. Ryze hesitated, unsure wether it was right for him to act and with the World Runes no less. Ryze meditated on the history of Runeterra and ultimately came to the conclusion that Runeterra was worthy to be saved, and activated the World Runes, defeating Aatrox and Xolaani.\nRyze is a old man with violet skin due to prolonged contact with the World Runes. His body is full of tattoos in runic styles. He is bald but has a scrappy black beard, tied togheter at the end with a hair ring. Ryze is shirtless except for a a leather shoulderguard with a sash holding it togheter. A giant scroll is attached to his back, held there by the leather sash. He wears fairly detailess, loose, dark blue pants with high leather boots. Around his waist he wears a leather belt with a book tied to it.\nRyze has become tired, longing for the day when all of this is over. Always in a hurry to get anything done as fast as possible. He tends to come across as quite rude, though argues its becouse he has better things to be doing. Though he is tired, he is steadfast in his goal and will get it done no matter what cost, even if that cost is the life of his friend or the death of a village. Their deaths are nothing compared to what the World Runes could bring.  Ryze has a strong control over his emotions, though he often gets mad, he never loses himself in an emotion. The only emotion he cannot control is hope, an emotion he tries desperately to get rid off, but always manages to influence him.\nKegan Rodhe, as he was known before he became Brand, was previously Ryze's apprentice, saved by Ryze from freezing to death in the harsh Freljordian cold.

Her people's survival is a constant, desperate battle against the elements, forcing them to raid Noxians , Demacians , and Avarosans alike to survive the harsh winters. Sejuani herself spearheads the most dangerous of these attacks from the saddle of her drüvask boar Bristle , using her True Ice flail to freeze and shatter her enemies.\nSejuani was born of a Freljord political marrige, daughter of the Warmother of the Winter's Claw , Kalkia. But her mother would quickly abandon the role of Warmother, instead pursuing another man she had her eyes on, leaving the tribe in chaos. Instead, Sejuani was raised by her Grandmother Heijan, a cold and uncaring mother figure who's expectations Sejuani could never seem to meet.\nThe Winter's Claw was left poor from the neglect of Kalkia, but during a visit to the Avarosan , Sejuani saw how well people could have it under a competent warmother. During her visit, Sejuani was taken in by the famous warrior and warmother, Grena, who Sejuani learned had once bested Kalkia in a duel, an act that earned Sejuani's adoration. It was also here she met with Grena's only daughter, Ashe , who became Sejuani's best and only friend. Though things quickly turned sour as Grena started to openly question Heijan's treatment of Sejuani, an act which infuriated Heijan. Heijan cut all ties with the Avarosan and started expanding into the surrounding tribes, which only further weakened the Winter's Claw.\nWord reached Kalkia about the failiures of the Winter's Claw, which brought her return where she proclaimed herself Warmother again. Sejuani was enraged by her mother's return and started secretly plotting to overthrow her and become the new warmother.\nDuring an expedition, Sejuani once more met with Ashe, who was starving and alone in Ursine lands after the Frostguard had destroyed the rest of the Avarosan. Sejuani took pitty on her old friend and brought her back to the Winter's Claw, an act which the new warmother and the Frostguard did not take kindly. Sejuani told Ashe about her plan to overthrow Kalkia and asked for Ashe's help, to which she agreed and they both swore and oath, making them Battlesisters. Though this friendship was short lived, for unbeknownst to Ashe; Sejuani's plan involved raiding and destroying the neighbouring tribe, the Ebrataal Tribe, to steal their supplies. Ashe did not approve of this raid and the two former battlesisters were now sworn enemies.\nAfter Ashe's betrayal, Sejuani completed another raid agaisnt a Noxus Warship, hoping it would be enough to rally the tribes in support of Sejuani. During this raid, Sejuani freed Bristle from the ship's slaughterhouse, who would become her most royal steed. This raid proved enough, and Sejuani returned back to the Winter's Claw to challange her mother to a duel, an act which was extremely taboo. Sejuani won decisively, killing her mother in the process.\nSejuani was now the new warmother and did not waste a second, she immediately began raiding and absorbing nearby tribes while also throwing out the Frostguard. Sejuani had taken the Winter's Claw from the brink of collapse and ruin, and had turned it into the most feared and brutal tribe of the Freljord.\nThe Freljord is currently undergoing the harshest winter in living memory, and the Winter's Claw are starving becouse of it.

The old man should have starved weeks ago and Sejuani was intrigued over how he was still alilve, where he mentioned that he had eaten from the Cauldron of Ornn , a legendary artifact with the ability to fully feed anyone who eats from it for, leaving them full for several weeks. But the Cauldron had been stolen by the Volibear and is deep in Ursine territory.

Sejuani believes that community is strength and is the only way to survive the Freljord. She holds the traditions of Freljord as truth and sees anyone who chooses to abandon their nomadic ways as a traitor and an enemy.\nSejuani and Ashe were once childhood friends but were seperated when Ashe's mother offended Sejuani's grandmother, Heijan, over how she was raising Sejuani. Years later, Sejuani found Ashe starving in Ursine lands after the Frostguard annihilated the rest of her tribe.

But refusing to lose hope, within the lantern Senna learned to use the Mist, and reemerged to new life, forever changed. Now wielding darkness along with light, Senna seeks to end the Black Mist by turning it against itself—with every blast of her relic weapon, redeeming the souls lost within.\nSenna was born on a small island off the coast of Demacia. As a girl, she found a shipwreck, washed ashore, and attempted to explore it. As she did so, a spark of life entered her, and she sensed the Black Mist reaching out to trap her. Senna and her village survived the Harrowing which visited them after, thanks to a Sentinel of Light named Urias. But after the encounter, it seemed that the Mist haunted Senna, following wherever she went. Urias took her under his wing, and started training her to fight back. Senna learned to keep others at arm's length, for anyone she let get near was always hurt when the Black Mist found her.\nWhen Urias was slain by wraiths which had followed her, Senna reluctantly travelled to Demacia, to inform his family. There, she met his son Lucian, who accompanied her to Urias' parting vigil. To Senna's surprise, Lucian managed to fire his father's gun, when more of the undead attacked them. As she trained him to become a Sentinel, she also fell in love.\nLucian, however, became obsessed with \"curing\" Senna of her curse. That obsession led them to a forgotten crypt where they fought Thresh, the Chain Warden. So close to discovering a cure, Lucian refused to retreat... and Senna took Thresh's hook to save him. Her soul was dragged into Thresh's lantern, and Lucian would spend several years trying to free her.\nFor months, Senna was unable to come to terms with her own terms. Gradually, she learned how to draw the Black Mist to her, away from others. She freed as many souls as she could, including lost Sentinels from whom she learned that she wasn't cursed with death, but with an abundance of life. She learned that the master of the Mist searched for what she possessed. Sometimes, she was even able to rally the souls within to rebel against Thresh.\nAs Lucian drove his pistol into Thresh's lantern, Senna escaped, shrouded in death and wielding a cannon made from other Sentinels' relic weapons. She used it to protect Lucian from Thresh's attack and then she sent Thresh flying, immediately afterwards the souls of the lantern were beginning to be absorbed again and she began to drag Senna as well. But Lucian managed to quickly reach her to hug her to avoid the flashlight would absorb it again.\n(TBA)\nSenna is portrayed as a low, toned and curvaceous black woman, her hair is long black tied with dreadlocks falling to one side, as a child her eyes were hazel brown. But when she exposed to the magical mist her eyes changed color to bright spectral green which shine an intense green when the black mist is near it.\nShe wears tight-fitting black and grayish light armor that covers her entire body and always wears a white caped hood with gold trim on her head, possibly a sentinel garment since it carries a pin with the faction's crest.\nSenna is a brave and quite determined girl, having been constantly running away from the black mist had made her become quite a hardened and distant person, but she started to be more open after she met Lucian.\nAfter being freed and resurrected she acquired an ideology that life needs death as much as death needs life, since then she has dedicated herself to helping the wraith find peace.\nSenna met Lucian to deliver the news of his father's death and traveled with him to take part in Urias' parting vigil. The two would eventually fall in love and she would train him to become a Sentinel of Light.\nDue to her connection to the Black Mist, Senna was aware of Thresh and his torture before eventually meeting him. He claimed her soul when she tried to save Lucian. Lucian traveled to Bilgewater in pursuit of the Harrowing to locate Thresh. It was then he found out Senna's soul is trapped inside the Chain Warden's lantern . Lucian continued to pursue the Mist to free her and finally succeeded , though he did not expect her to come back to life. After the events of Rise of the Sentinels , Lucian and Senna continue their quest to stop Thresh , now that he is unbound from the Shadow Isles.\nAfter Senna was freed, the couple's main goal was to stop Viego and the Black Mist. Viego fought Lucian and Senna to reclaim the fragment Isolde's soul within her, and partially removed.\nGwen allied herself with Lucian and Senna to aid the Sentinels of Light and oppose Viego. Both her and Gwen contain fragments of Isolde's soul.\nLucian and Senna recruited multiple Sentinels of Light to aid them against Viego, including: Diana , Graves , Irelia , Olaf , Pyke , Rengar , Riven , and Vayne .\nSenna disapproves of Akshan's multiple Sentinel code violations."}

Though these sounds overwhelmed her in her youth, she now draws on them for inspiration, turning the chaos into a symphony. She performs for the sister cities to remind their citizens that they’re not alone, that they’re stronger together, and that, in her eyes, their potential is limitless.\nAs a young girl, Seraphine developed a passion for music of all kinds. This passion only grew after her Mother's departure, leaving just her and her father in their Piltovian home. As she grew older Seraphine began to develop her magical powers, however her power was so strong that she quickly began to feel overwhelmed and could not hear herself which caused her to begin trying to repress them. Her father, seeing the anguish his daughter was going through, created special hearing aids that would help her stabilize her powers. Seraphine's subtle updates to her stage and \"secret\" underground trips to Zaun continued throughout her adolescent years, as she grew even more involved with the antics of the war, finding her place in the conflict. Soon it became evident that her father was both aware and proud of her musical antics, seeing his previous dream of sharing his songs with the world in his daughter.\nAt some point, Seraphine met Acorn, her chipmunk companion (otherwise known as \"the Hextechnician\"), who began accompanying her on her undisclosed trips underground. Seraphine's father began helping her with her equipment, touching up her guitar after long concerts, while she focused on making her disguise as flashy as possible.\nSeraphine slowly began building her reputation throughout Zaun, performing soulful concerts and attracting large groups of its citizens, who were dazed and intrigued by her colorful, powerful songs. She actively began competing with other popular performers underground, including the infamous Zaun Diva, Scratch, both impressed with the other's musical capabilities.\nSeraphine is a beautiful pale-skinned young woman with bright blue sapphire eyes and dyed bright pink hair tipped with dark violet that reaches her knees. She wears bright pink lipstick makeup and a light blue star painted on her right cheek.\nHer attire is a mix of Piltovan and Zaunite aesthetics with an added visual flair for her theatrical performances. She wears a brown garb over a leather blue shirt, with leather gloves and a matching leather blue skirt with leather boots.\nSeraphine is a warm, friendly person and very fond of music, when she was a child she liked to play in her parents' workshop when her magic power grew she became somewhat withdrawn as she heard many voices and could not hear herself, her parents created some special hearing aids for her that helped her control that power.\nWhen she came down to the city of Zaun, she was overcome with many emotions, most of them negative due to Piltover's contempt for Zaun. When she sang for the first time at the border of the two cities, she proudly saw how the people of both cities lived in harmony, so she set herself a goal that through her music she would unite the two neighboring cities.\nSeraphine understands the brackerns ' singing language to an extent thanks to her magical hearing, therefore she comprehends the song from the hextech crystal in her platform. She'd probably be the only human able to communicate well with Skarner . However, she does not know that they seek help, and they do enjoy her songs of togetherness.\nCaitlyn is an adoring fan of Seraphine's singing performance.\nAcorn is Seraphine's pet squirrel whom often acts as her companion. Acorn is believed by Seraphine's fans to be the heart of her idol operation, but in truth he is often disobedient and uncontrollable, to her annoyance.\nBeing an acoustician, Seraphine's father gave her a hextech device to dampen her acute magical hearing. Proud of Seraphine's idol career, he supports her performances even if she withholds details from him and even allowed her to perform in the Undercity.\nMillie is one of Seraphine's biggest fans and the leader of her fan club. While she is too shy to engage in conversation before leaving, Seraphine still enjoys talking with Millie.\nScratch has a friendly rivalry towards Seraphine, with both having enjoyment performing together. Judging by her flustered reaction when Acoustician tells her Seraphine talks about her a lot, Scratch's feelings toward Seraphine may be greater than just simple friendship."}

Seraphine's subtle updates to her stage and \"secret\" underground trips to Zaun continued throughout her adolescent years, as she grew even more involved with the antics of the war, finding her place in the conflict. Soon it became evident that her father was both aware and proud of her musical antics, seeing his previous dream of sharing his songs with the world in his daughter.\nAt some point, Seraphine met Acorn, her chipmunk companion (otherwise known as \"the Hextechnician\"), who began accompanying her on her undisclosed trips underground. Seraphine's father began helping her with her equipment, touching up her guitar after long concerts, while she focused on making her disguise as flashy as possible.\nSeraphine slowly began building her reputation throughout Zaun, performing soulful concerts and attracting large groups of its citizens, who were dazed and intrigued by her colorful, powerful songs. She actively began competing with other popular performers underground, including the infamous Zaun Diva, Scratch, both impressed with the other's musical capabilities.\nSeraphine is a beautiful pale-skinned young woman with bright blue sapphire eyes and dyed bright pink hair tipped with dark violet that reaches her knees. She wears bright pink lipstick makeup and a light blue star painted on her right cheek.\nHer attire is a mix of Piltovan and Zaunite aesthetics with an added visual flair for her theatrical performances. She wears a brown garb over a leather blue shirt, with leather gloves and a matching leather blue skirt with leather boots.\nSeraphine is a warm, friendly person and very fond of music, when she was a child she liked to play in her parents' workshop when her magic power grew she became somewhat withdrawn as she heard many voices and could not hear herself, her parents created some special hearing aids for her that helped her control that power.\nWhen she came down to the city of Zaun, she was overcome with many emotions, most of them negative due to Piltover's contempt for Zaun. When she sang for the first time at the border of the two cities, she proudly saw how the people of both cities lived in harmony, so she set herself a goal that through her music she would unite the two neighboring cities.\nSeraphine understands the brackerns ' singing language to an extent thanks to her magical hearing, therefore she comprehends the song from the hextech crystal in her platform. She'd probably be the only human able to communicate well with Skarner . However, she does not know that they seek help, and they do enjoy her songs of togetherness.\nCaitlyn is an adoring fan of Seraphine's singing performance.\nAcorn is Seraphine's pet squirrel whom often acts as her companion. Acorn is believed by Seraphine's fans to be the heart of her idol operation, but in truth he is often disobedient and uncontrollable, to her annoyance.\nBeing an acoustician, Seraphine's father gave her a hextech device to dampen her acute magical hearing. Proud of Seraphine's idol career, he supports her performances even if she withholds details from him and even allowed her to perform in the Undercity.\nMillie is one of Seraphine's biggest fans and the leader of her fan club. While she is too shy to engage in conversation before leaving, Seraphine still enjoys talking with Millie.\nScratch has a friendly rivalry towards Seraphine, with both having enjoyment performing together. Judging by her flustered reaction when Acoustician tells her Seraphine talks about her a lot, Scratch's feelings toward Seraphine may be greater than just simple friendship."}

Though she most often appears humanoid, she can take her true form when necessary—that of a fearsome dragon, incinerating her foes with fiery breath. Having saved the life of the crown prince Jarvan IV , Shyvana now serves uneasily in his royal guard, struggling to find acceptance among the suspicious people of Demacia .\nShyvana was born from Yvva, a powerful fire dragon. Prior to hatching, her egg was captured by a mage, and Yvva could not get it back. The mage kept the egg, and it hatched, but instead of being born as a baby dragon, Shyvana was born as a human with unnatural, pale blue skin. The mage grew fond of the little girl and decided to raise her as his daughter in secret. As Shyvana grew, she discovered more and more of her latent abilities. The mage did everything he could to help her control her budding draconic magic and, by her adolescence, she was able to transform between her human form and that of a powerful dragon at will.\nYvva, who had a psychic connection with her daughter, managed to track her down. In her rage, she burned down the entire town Shyvana called home. Shyvana hid amidst some ruins, watching helplessly as her mother rained fire from above. The mage himself did not escape the flames. Shyvana watched on as he succumbed to the inferno and, when her mother was finished, she came out of hiding, retrieved his charred corpse, and gave him a simple burial. She mourned her once-captor turned adoptive father—slain by her very mother—alone.\nFearful that her mother might return, Shyvana took to living on the move, never staying in the same place twice. One day, wandering through a forest, she picked up the aroma of fresh, human blood among the scent of trees and fauna. Following her nose, she found a wounded warrior on the verge of death. Transforming into her draconic form, she took the unconscious man to Wrenwall castle, saving his life. There, she found that this man was none other than Prince Jarvan IV, sole son and heir apparent to the throne of Demacia. The soldiers of the castle looked upon Shyvana with disgust because of her magical nature, but for her valor in saving the prince, she was treated with respect. She would later reflect that her time spent there was the most serene time of her life.\nHowever, serenity never lasts and, in her peace, Shyvana had forgotten her pursuer. Yvva found her there, among the Demacians, and Shyvana knew what would surely follow. The soldiers quickly sent the civilians inside the fortress to protect them and, knowing her mother's quarry was her alone, Shyvana prepared to flee. Prince Jarvan intercepted Shyvana's attempted escape, forcing the half-dragon to tearfully tell him the truth: This dragon was none other than her mother, and so long as Shyvana herself was here, both him and his people were in danger. Jarvan, never having forgotten the kindness Shyvana had showed him by saving his life, swore then that he would never abandon her, nor allow her to face her mother alone.  Moved, Shyvana accepted the offer of aid, and prepared to face Yvva with the might of Demacia by her side.\nAs Yvva appeared on the horizon, the castle archers began distracting her with arrows. She sprayed a burst of fire on the castle in retaliation, heavily wounding the archer line. Just as she let her guard down, Shyvana sprinted out of the palace and leapt into the air, transformed into dragon in mid-flight. Shyvana and Yvva fought a fierce and gruesome battle. Shyvana had never used her abilities in such a way before. Remembering the people she was protecting, and those who were hurt protecting her, Shyvana grabbed her mother's head, and broke Yvva's neck on a castle wall, closing the battle.\nFollowing the confrontation with her mother, Prince Jarvan IV honored Shyvana's bravery, and asked whether she would journey with him to Demacia proper. Shyvana wholeheartedly accepted. Though Shyvana was afraid that she would be distrusted due to her nature, these proved to be unfounded: The people of Demacia welcomed her as a hero, and Prince Jarvan offered her a place within the elite group known as the Dragonguard, so she might protect this land from other dangerous dragons like Yvva.\nDuring the rebellion of the magicians, Jarvan confronted Sylas . The two had an arduous battle, and Sylas nearly bested the prince, but, just before Sylas could finish the job, Shyvana descended from the sky and disrupted the battle, prepared to honor her role as Dragonguard.\nSylas faced the two of them, and a fierce fight ensued. A furious Shyvana implored Jarvan to withdraw, and, trusting her judgment, he listened. With the prince out of the way, Shyvana was free to transform into her draconic form, ready to crush Sylas once and for all. But she underestimated the Kingslayer, and he bested her. Wounded, she reverted to her human form and plummeted to the ground. Sylas moved in for the kill, and Prince Jarvan intercepted him, risking his own life to protect not merely a guard, not merely a woman, but a being of pure magic. Quick on the uptake, Sylas noted their connection, and accused the crown prince of hypocrisy. While Sylas rotted in prison for his magic, the prince had fallen in love with a being composed of it. Seeing how injured his opponents were, Sylas once again moved in to kill Jarvan, but Shyvana, with what forces she still possessed, conjured a circle of fire around the two of them, cutting Sylas off. In the end, Sylas had no choice but to flee, but not before swearing that he would kill the prince and his beloved dragon. Slipping into unconsciousness, Shyvana collapsed into Jarvan's arms.\nFollowing the battle, Shyvana had no choice but to leave Demacia due to the countless rules against wizards and magical beings. As he once had, Jarvan tried to convince her not to leave, and she suggested that they leave together, and start a new life. He told her what she already knew: He couldn't do it. Before she left, she implored him not to allow his father's ruthlessness to pass on to the kingdom Jarvan would rule, but Jarvan told her that it was too late for that. With a sad smile, she replied that no transformation lasts forever, and wished him good luck. She then jumped from the castle tower and, assuming draconic form, flew away from the castle, though, perhaps, never too far.\nAfter Jarvan disbanded the Mageseekers , Shyvana is seen returning from the horizon, finally free to come home.\nShyvana is portrayed as a slender woman with pale blue skin, black hair tied in a ponytail with two strands braided over her shoulders, and blue eyes with slit pupils which glow fiery red when she's enraged. She wears red and gold colored armor which covers her head, arms and legs. In her monstrous form, she turns into a medium-sized red and gray dragon.\nDespite being half dragon, Shyvana possesses human emotions because she was raised among them. She is loyal, kind, and helpful to all who show her affection, but she is not without a rather fiery temperament, when provoked.\nJarvan IV was saved by Shyvana after escaping from the Noxian capture and later helped her in slaying her mother, Yvva, and, out of gratitude, she earned a spot in the Demacian Elite Guard. In Lux comics , it was revealed Jarvan loved someone that wasn't so different from the mages. That person may be Shyvana herself.\nShe would later join the Dragonguard , a special branch of the Demacian military tasked in defending Demacian lands from dragons. While some are close to Shyvana and trust her, others are skeptical due to her nature.\nIn Rise of the Sentinels , Shyvana was imprisoned by the Mageseekers . Becoming disillusioned with Demacia's magical prejudices, Shyvana gives in to the ruination after Viego's awakening, destroying a Mageseeker compound and terrorizing the Demacian army.\nVayne claims that Shyvana is a monster, so she distrusted her even before she was possessed. After Lucian and Senna arrived and helped Vayne knock Ruined Shyvana out, Vayne was prepared to kill her until Senna intervened. Senna determined that Shyvana's true self is still within her. After Viego was defeated, Shyvana was freed along with the other champions from his control and returned to her normal self."}

Though she most often appears humanoid, she can take her true form when necessary—that of a fearsome dragon, incinerating her foes with fiery breath. Having saved the life of the crown prince Jarvan IV , Shyvana now serves uneasily in his royal guard, struggling to find acceptance among the suspicious people of Demacia .\nShyvana was born from Yvva, a powerful fire dragon. Prior to hatching, her egg was captured by a mage, and Yvva could not get it back. The mage kept the egg, and it hatched, but instead of being born as a baby dragon, Shyvana was born as a human with unnatural, pale blue skin. The mage grew fond of the little girl and decided to raise her as his daughter in secret. As Shyvana grew, she discovered more and more of her latent abilities. The mage did everything he could to help her control her budding draconic magic and, by her adolescence, she was able to transform between her human form and that of a powerful dragon at will.\nYvva, who had a psychic connection with her daughter, managed to track her down. In her rage, she burned down the entire town Shyvana called home. Shyvana hid amidst some ruins, watching helplessly as her mother rained fire from above. The mage himself did not escape the flames. Shyvana watched on as he succumbed to the inferno and, when her mother was finished, she came out of hiding, retrieved his charred corpse, and gave him a simple burial. She mourned her once-captor turned adoptive father—slain by her very mother—alone.\nFearful that her mother might return, Shyvana took to living on the move, never staying in the same place twice. One day, wandering through a forest, she picked up the aroma of fresh, human blood among the scent of trees and fauna. Following her nose, she found a wounded warrior on the verge of death. Transforming into her draconic form, she took the unconscious man to Wrenwall castle, saving his life. There, she found that this man was none other than Prince Jarvan IV, sole son and heir apparent to the throne of Demacia. The soldiers of the castle looked upon Shyvana with disgust because of her magical nature, but for her valor in saving the prince, she was treated with respect. She would later reflect that her time spent there was the most serene time of her life.\nHowever, serenity never lasts and, in her peace, Shyvana had forgotten her pursuer. Yvva found her there, among the Demacians, and Shyvana knew what would surely follow. The soldiers quickly sent the civilians inside the fortress to protect them and, knowing her mother's quarry was her alone, Shyvana prepared to flee. Prince Jarvan intercepted Shyvana's attempted escape, forcing the half-dragon to tearfully tell him the truth: This dragon was none other than her mother, and so long as Shyvana herself was here, both him and his people were in danger. Jarvan, never having forgotten the kindness Shyvana had showed him by saving his life, swore then that he would never abandon her, nor allow her to face her mother alone.  Moved, Shyvana accepted the offer of aid, and prepared to face Yvva with the might of Demacia by her side.\nAs Yvva appeared on the horizon, the castle archers began distracting her with arrows. She sprayed a burst of fire on the castle in retaliation, heavily wounding the archer line. Just as she let her guard down, Shyvana sprinted out of the palace and leapt into the air, transformed into dragon in mid-flight. Shyvana and Yvva fought a fierce and gruesome battle. Shyvana had never used her abilities in such a way before. Remembering the people she was protecting, and those who were hurt protecting her, Shyvana grabbed her mother's head, and broke Yvva's neck on a castle wall, closing the battle.\nFollowing the confrontation with her mother, Prince Jarvan IV honored Shyvana's bravery, and asked whether she would journey with him to Demacia proper. Shyvana wholeheartedly accepted. Though Shyvana was afraid that she would be distrusted due to her nature, these proved to be unfounded: The people of Demacia welcomed her as a hero, and Prince Jarvan offered her a place within the elite group known as the Dragonguard, so she might protect this land from other dangerous dragons like Yvva.\nDuring the rebellion of the magicians, Jarvan confronted Sylas . The two had an arduous battle, and Sylas nearly bested the prince, but, just before Sylas could finish the job, Shyvana descended from the sky and disrupted the battle, prepared to honor her role as Dragonguard.\nSylas faced the two of them, and a fierce fight ensued. A furious Shyvana implored Jarvan to withdraw, and, trusting her judgment, he listened. With the prince out of the way, Shyvana was free to transform into her draconic form, ready to crush Sylas once and for all. But she underestimated the Kingslayer, and he bested her. Wounded, she reverted to her human form and plummeted to the ground. Sylas moved in for the kill, and Prince Jarvan intercepted him, risking his own life to protect not merely a guard, not merely a woman, but a being of pure magic. Quick on the uptake, Sylas noted their connection, and accused the crown prince of hypocrisy. While Sylas rotted in prison for his magic, the prince had fallen in love with a being composed of it. Seeing how injured his opponents were, Sylas once again moved in to kill Jarvan, but Shyvana, with what forces she still possessed, conjured a circle of fire around the two of them, cutting Sylas off. In the end, Sylas had no choice but to flee, but not before swearing that he would kill the prince and his beloved dragon. Slipping into unconsciousness, Shyvana collapsed into Jarvan's arms.\nFollowing the battle, Shyvana had no choice but to leave Demacia due to the countless rules against wizards and magical beings. As he once had, Jarvan tried to convince her not to leave, and she suggested that they leave together, and start a new life. He told her what she already knew: He couldn't do it. Before she left, she implored him not to allow his father's ruthlessness to pass on to the kingdom Jarvan would rule, but Jarvan told her that it was too late for that. With a sad smile, she replied that no transformation lasts forever, and wished him good luck. She then jumped from the castle tower and, assuming draconic form, flew away from the castle, though, perhaps, never too far.\nAfter Jarvan disbanded the Mageseekers , Shyvana is seen returning from the horizon, finally free to come home.\nShyvana is portrayed as a slender woman with pale blue skin, black hair tied in a ponytail with two strands braided over her shoulders, and blue eyes with slit pupils which glow fiery red when she's enraged.

Is there a method to his madness? His concoctions rarely fail, but it appears to many that Singed has lost all sense of humanity, leaving a toxic trail of misery and terror in his wake.\nSinged began his life as an ordinary man in Piltover . As a child, he showed advanced intellect and curiosity being fascinated with the natural world. Eventually, he would be accepted into the University of Piltover, where he would conduct groundbreaking research. However, he was not recognized for this research, as he was a vocal critic of hextech, which his colleagues ridiculed him for. Eventually, he would lose all funding for his research and move to Zaun . There, he would make money from his inventions, which covered a wide range of uses. He would also begin to chemically augment himself, allowing him to work for days without needing to rest. His ingenuity gained him recognition in Zaun and soon attracted the attention of the Noxian empire.\nAfter years of doing smaller projects for the empire, Singed was approached by a Noxian military commander Emystan, who contracted the alchemist to help her break the stalemate of the war in Ionia . She gave him an offer that would bring him considerably more funds for his continued research.\nPutting aside all other concerns, Singed poured all of his intellect, knowledge, and experience into the synthesis of this new weapon. The result of his efforts was an alchemical fire that was unstable and volatile. When it was finally unleashed in Ionia against the enemies of Noxus, it burned hot enough to fracture stone, and tainted the earth around it with dense, metallic poisons so completely that almost nothing could grow there. Even Emystan’s own allies were appalled, though not quite enough to name her and Singed as war criminals.\nWith the funds procured from this venture, Singed was able to considerably expand his Zaunite laboratory with new equipment.\nSinged kidnapped a gangster who he named Subject #1088, whom wanted to reform his life after retiring from crime. For years, he subjected him to many torturous experiments by augmenting chemtech upgrades on him while he was fully conscious, since Singed believed that pain was the catalyst to immortality. After implementing the chemtech pump onto Warwick's body, he turned hostile and started to attack Singed, but after the two struggled for a while Warwick succumbed to his injuries. Disappointed in his experiment's failure, Singed disposed of Warwick's body, but the latter came back to life as a chimera and escaped during the night. Singed woke up from the noise and found the damage inflicted upon his lab. He decided to find a new lab, but also start investigating Warwick so he could start the next phase of his experiment.\nSinged kidnapped two men named Hadri Spillwether and Palo, codenaming them Thinker and Breaker respectively, trapping them in a glass cage and performing inhumane surgeries on them (implanting a parasite into Hadri's chest and augmenting Palo with pneumatochem-muscular enhancements) while recording his experiment using a recording device. He interrogated Hadri on all of the details of his life, and when he was unable to answer or refused, Singed blasted him with cold sump water. When Hadri tried to empathize with Singed by telling him about his (fictional) son Locke, Singed told Hadri that he had no family and he begged him for a cure for his illness, but would be reduced to nothing as he wouldn't comply. He then told Hadri to latch onto Palo to join the parasite. When Hadri stood up to his captor, he deemed him uncooperative and turned the water valve to full strength before leaving, intending to flood the lab to drown the two subjects.\nHadri and Palo cooperated to escape the lab, but the parasite attached to Palo as Singed had intended, causing the two subjects to have their minds linked. After being confronted by followers of Viktor, they came face to face with Singed, who tested Hadri to see if his mind was still intact, threatening to shoot them with a tranquilizer gun if they didn't comply. When he was unable to get the results he wanted, Singed believed that they were a failure and provoked them into chasing him, gradually weakening them with his poisonous gas. As they fell down on the verge of death, Hadri recognized the professor as Singed back when he was in Piltover, and Singed told Hadri that he was Thinker Four and he'd fared much better than Thinker Two (implying he'd done similar experiments before). He then walked away, leaving Hadri and Palo to die in despair.\nNot much is known about how Singed looked like when he was young. However, throughout most of his life, he was a tall, lanky, and pale man. He has a permanent facial scar on one side of his face (some depictions show his right side being damaged, while others his left side). Eventually Singed would start wearing additional bandages to hide the facial scars inflicted by Warwick .\nSinged is a cruel, heartless scientist with no regard for his victims, performing depraved experiments on his test subjects for the belief that they would become superior beings, while subjecting them to physical and mental suffering with no remorse and seeing them as nothing more than lesser creatures or objects to experiment on. He is a perfectionist who doesn't like when people fail his high standards, and feels nothing but disappointment when they die.\nAs Singed forced Warwick into being a test subject for one of his unethical experiments, it can be assumed that Warwick hates him more than anything. Given that Singed also showed no remorse towards Warwick as he subjected the latter to many brutal procedures, it can also be assumed that he sees Warwick not as a living organism, but as an object to be researched and studied.\nSinged helped Noxus invade Ionia by giving them a toxic substance that Noxus used to kill their enemies and raze their land. This would affect many people, including Riven , who was scarred from the sight of the substance being used on others, Irelia and Karma , whose forces were killed by the substance, and Master Yi , whose village was razed by the substance.\nSinged saw Hadri and Palo as nothing more than test subjects, showing no empathy toward them as he cruelly experimented on them and disciplining them by blasting them with cold sump water for failing his standards. When Hadri tried to empathize with him, Singed mocked him and told Hadri that he owed him after begging him to cure his illness, but promised that he wouldn't die. Once Hadri stood up to him, Singed began to flood the lab to drown them so he could dispose of them and start over. When they escaped, Singed asked them if they knew him and when he was unable to answer, Singed believed them to be mindless vegetables and deemed the experiment a failure. Once Hadri finally remembered who Singed was, he told him that he'd done better as a Thinker test subject than his second Thinker before he and Palo died."}

Disappointed in his experiment's failure, Singed disposed of Warwick's body, but the latter came back to life as a chimera and escaped during the night. Singed woke up from the noise and found the damage inflicted upon his lab. He decided to find a new lab, but also start investigating Warwick so he could start the next phase of his experiment.\nSinged kidnapped two men named Hadri Spillwether and Palo, codenaming them Thinker and Breaker respectively, trapping them in a glass cage and performing inhumane surgeries on them (implanting a parasite into Hadri's chest and augmenting Palo with pneumatochem-muscular enhancements) while recording his experiment using a recording device. He interrogated Hadri on all of the details of his life, and when he was unable to answer or refused, Singed blasted him with cold sump water. When Hadri tried to empathize with Singed by telling him about his (fictional) son Locke, Singed told Hadri that he had no family and he begged him for a cure for his illness, but would be reduced to nothing as he wouldn't comply. He then told Hadri to latch onto Palo to join the parasite. When Hadri stood up to his captor, he deemed him uncooperative and turned the water valve to full strength before leaving, intending to flood the lab to drown the two subjects.\nHadri and Palo cooperated to escape the lab, but the parasite attached to Palo as Singed had intended, causing the two subjects to have their minds linked. After being confronted by followers of Viktor, they came face to face with Singed, who tested Hadri to see if his mind was still intact, threatening to shoot them with a tranquilizer gun if they didn't comply. When he was unable to get the results he wanted, Singed believed that they were a failure and provoked them into chasing him, gradually weakening them with his poisonous gas. As they fell down on the verge of death, Hadri recognized the professor as Singed back when he was in Piltover, and Singed told Hadri that he was Thinker Four and he'd fared much better than Thinker Two (implying he'd done similar experiments before). He then walked away, leaving Hadri and Palo to die in despair.\nNot much is known about how Singed looked like when he was young. However, throughout most of his life, he was a tall, lanky, and pale man. He has a permanent facial scar on one side of his face (some depictions show his right side being damaged, while others his left side). Eventually Singed would start wearing additional bandages to hide the facial scars inflicted by Warwick .\nSinged is a cruel, heartless scientist with no regard for his victims, performing depraved experiments on his test subjects for the belief that they would become superior beings, while subjecting them to physical and mental suffering with no remorse and seeing them as nothing more than lesser creatures or objects to experiment on. He is a perfectionist who doesn't like when people fail his high standards, and feels nothing but disappointment when they die.\nAs Singed forced Warwick into being a test subject for one of his unethical experiments, it can be assumed that Warwick hates him more than anything. Given that Singed also showed no remorse towards Warwick as he subjected the latter to many brutal procedures, it can also be assumed that he sees Warwick not as a living organism, but as an object to be researched and studied.\nSinged helped Noxus invade Ionia by giving them a toxic substance that Noxus used to kill their enemies and raze their land. This would affect many people, including Riven , who was scarred from the sight of the substance being used on others, Irelia and Karma , whose forces were killed by the substance, and Master Yi , whose village was razed by the substance.\nSinged saw Hadri and Palo as nothing more than test subjects, showing no empathy toward them as he cruelly experimented on them and disciplining them by blasting them with cold sump water for failing his standards. When Hadri tried to empathize with him, Singed mocked him and told Hadri that he owed him after begging him to cure his illness, but promised that he wouldn't die. Once Hadri stood up to him, Singed began to flood the lab to drown them so he could dispose of them and start over. When they escaped, Singed asked them if they knew him and when he was unable to answer, Singed believed them to be mindless vegetables and deemed the experiment a failure. Once Hadri finally remembered who Singed was, he told him that he'd done better as a Thinker test subject than his second Thinker before he and Palo died."}

Armed with her legendary jewelled crossblade , she has fought and won countless battles for those who can afford her exorbitant price. Known for her fearless resolve and endless ambition, she prides herself on recovering buried treasures from the perilous tombs of Shurima - for a generous bounty. With ancient forces stirring the very bones of Shurima, Sivir finds herself torn between conflicting destinies.\nSivir was born in Shurima, her childhood was very hard as her parents were killed by looters and she alone had to grow up on the streets along with other orphans stealing food from local markets and delving into ancient ruins in search of trinkets that she could sell.\nSivir sometimes had to fight with the other children to keep some of the loot they found, but she rarely kept anything, after her so-called friend Mira tricked her and stole it, Sivir swore to herself that no one would ever come back to betray.\nWhen she reached adolescence she became the guide and lackey of a group of mercenaries led by the well-known daughter Siharo, although her skill with weapons led her to become Siharo's sergeant, Sivir realized that she was left with most of the treasures even if they were obtained thanks to Sivir. Sivir gathered her fellow mercenaries and rebelled against Siharo, the two duelled and Sivir emerged victorious, but was unable to kill her mentor and abandoned her in the desert wishing her luck to rebuild her life.\nSivir and her mercenaries earned a great reputation which was known throughout the desert, they accepted any task offered to them if the pay was very good, one day she and her companions were given the task of recovering an ancient relic known as the Chalikar .Accompanied by the buyer's personal guards, Sivir searched for the relic for several months and finally found it, the weapon left Sivir amazed as it was quite magnificent, the captain of the guard told Sivir to give it to her but she refused and with just one movement of the weapon decapitated him and all his followers and Sivir fled with the weapon in hand. Sivir's reputation grew further and she became known beyond the desert, when the Noxian expeditions heard about her, it was Cassiopeia Du Coteau who was most interested in her exploits and proceeded to hire Sivir to sack the ancient city of Shurima.\nLittle by little they entered the ruins of the city, several of Sivir's companions died due to the constant traps they found, but Cassiopeia refused to back down, when they reached the great door of a tomb surrounded by ancient statues of guardians and reliefs of the warriors of the past ,Sivir was quite captivated by those beast-headed beings and their great fights against monsters of the underworld, taking advantage of Sivir's distraction. Cassiopeia stabbed Sivir with a dagger in the back causing her to scream in pain and collapse soaking the sand her blood, Cassiopeia took the Chalikar from her dying body to open the door to the tomb, unaware that it unleashed a powerful curse. Near death, Sivir watched as the statue of a giant serpent came to life and proceeded to spray Cassiopeia with his poison.\nSivir took her Chalikar and tried to flee from the tomb, but near the exit life began to leave her body and she fell to the ground, the last thing she heard before she fainted was the roars of maddened Gods being released from the tomb .But surprisingly that was not the end because she opened her eyes and realized that her wounds had healed and in front of her was her savior. Azir the last emperor of Shurima, he explained to her that Sivir is his descendant and that through his veins runs royal blood. He explained to her that the blood he had spilled had awakened her spirit and he took her to the pool of life where he healed her wounds. Azir later began to complete his ascension and Sivir watched in amazement as he became an Ascended and the ancient Shurima began to rise from the sands. Sivir quickly ran out of the pool and saw how the ancient Shurima returned from the grave.

Armed with her legendary jewelled crossblade , she has fought and won countless battles for those who can afford her exorbitant price. Known for her fearless resolve and endless ambition, she prides herself on recovering buried treasures from the perilous tombs of Shurima - for a generous bounty. With ancient forces stirring the very bones of Shurima, Sivir finds herself torn between conflicting destinies.\nSivir was born in Shurima, her childhood was very hard as her parents were killed by looters and she alone had to grow up on the streets along with other orphans stealing food from local markets and delving into ancient ruins in search of trinkets that she could sell.\nSivir sometimes had to fight with the other children to keep some of the loot they found, but she rarely kept anything, after her so-called friend Mira tricked her and stole it, Sivir swore to herself that no one would ever come back to betray.\nWhen she reached adolescence she became the guide and lackey of a group of mercenaries led by the well-known daughter Siharo, although her skill with weapons led her to become Siharo's sergeant, Sivir realized that she was left with most of the treasures even if they were obtained thanks to Sivir. Sivir gathered her fellow mercenaries and rebelled against Siharo, the two duelled and Sivir emerged victorious, but was unable to kill her mentor and abandoned her in the desert wishing her luck to rebuild her life.\nSivir and her mercenaries earned a great reputation which was known throughout the desert, they accepted any task offered to them if the pay was very good, one day she and her companions were given the task of recovering an ancient relic known as the Chalikar .Accompanied by the buyer's personal guards, Sivir searched for the relic for several months and finally found it, the weapon left Sivir amazed as it was quite magnificent, the captain of the guard told Sivir to give it to her but she refused and with just one movement of the weapon decapitated him and all his followers and Sivir fled with the weapon in hand. Sivir's reputation grew further and she became known beyond the desert, when the Noxian expeditions heard about her, it was Cassiopeia Du Coteau who was most interested in her exploits and proceeded to hire Sivir to sack the ancient city of Shurima.\nLittle by little they entered the ruins of the city, several of Sivir's companions died due to the constant traps they found, but Cassiopeia refused to back down, when they reached the great door of a tomb surrounded by ancient statues of guardians and reliefs of the warriors of the past ,Sivir was quite captivated by those beast-headed beings and their great fights against monsters of the underworld, taking advantage of Sivir's distraction. Cassiopeia stabbed Sivir with a dagger in the back causing her to scream in pain and collapse soaking the sand her blood, Cassiopeia took the Chalikar from her dying body to open the door to the tomb, unaware that it unleashed a powerful curse. Near death, Sivir watched as the statue of a giant serpent came to life and proceeded to spray Cassiopeia with his poison.\nSivir took her Chalikar and tried to flee from the tomb, but near the exit life began to leave her body and she fell to the ground, the last thing she heard before she fainted was the roars of maddened Gods being released from the tomb .But surprisingly that was not the end because she opened her eyes and realized that her wounds had healed and in front of her was her savior. Azir the last emperor of Shurima, he explained to her that Sivir is his descendant and that through his veins runs royal blood. He explained to her that the blood he had spilled had awakened her spirit and he took her to the pool of life where he healed her wounds. Azir later began to complete his ascension and Sivir watched in amazement as he became an Ascended and the ancient Shurima began to rise from the sands. Sivir quickly ran out of the pool and saw how the ancient Shurima returned from the grave. Now Sivir, along with Nasus and Taliyah , is preparing to decide whether to embrace the fate they gave her or forge her own on the sands of Shurima.\nSivir is possessed of a mercenary's code of values and isn't motivated by anything as much as material wealth.

Devoted to keeping his nation safe from the rest of the world, Skarner dwells in a chamber beneath Ixaocan where he can hear the vibrations of the earth and detect potential threats. As more members of the Yun Tal begin questioning Ixtal's self-isolation, Skarner grows increasingly paranoid and will do anything to keep Ixtal and its people safe—no matter the cost.\nSkarner was born to the legendary brackern broodmother Nixalẹ alongside many other bracklings in his brood. While most left to form their own clans, Skarner remained alongside Nixalẹ to study her power and wisdom out of curiosity, giving him the opportunity to hone his elemental geomancy and learn how to feel underground vibrations to detect movement across the earth.\nWhen he got older, he felt a dramatic shift as humans came to the land to found their settlement now known as Ixtal . While most of Clan Ọ̀pal-hin distrusted the humans, Skarner was curious to learn more about them. He silently observed their civilization, noticing how they made the most of their lives creating and innovating before passing away. Believing the subjects of his curiosity to be fragile, he intervened to save them from a rockslide that would destroy their settlement, earning him their worship towards him as their protector. Believing his protection was the only way they could survive, Skarner made it his duty to guard the Ixtali while also shaping the earth to create new plots for them to expand their civilization, and in return they shared their culture. He was one of the founding members of the Yun Tal , a ruling caste dedicated to leading the Ixtali to a brighter future.\nAs the protector of Ixtal, Skarner listened to the earth's vibrations for any threats to the nation, the most concerning being the encroaching Shuriman Empire. Eventually, the forces of Shurima would arrive at Ixtal and offered them an opportunity to form an alliance. The Yun Tal accepted, despite Skarner's protest, due his distrust of their lust for power. After Shurima collapsed as the result of the Icathian rebellion, Ixtal had regained its independence, but Skarner was left distrustful towards the world outside Ixtal. His fears worsened after witnessing the destruction caused by the Rune Wars , eventually convincing the Yun Tal to isolate Ixtal from the rest of the world. Left bitter towards the Yun Tal's failure to protect Ixtal, he decided that he would be Ixtal's sole protector, creating an underground chamber beneath Ixaocan to amplify the vibrational threads around the continent so he could always sense any potential threats. Eventually, he decided to stay in his chamber permanently, but as newer generations of Ixtali started to question their civilization's self-isolation, Skarner's paranoia began to grow. Believing that ending their isolation would lead to disastrous consequences for Ixtal, Skarner swore to protect Ixtal no matter the cost, even if it meant their destruction.\nSkarner is a kaiju-sized scorpion-like creature with six legs, a pair of thick grasping pincers, and three long tails ending in stingers. He has a teal and white carapace decorated with orange, teal, and white paint. His head is vaguely human-like despite its chitinous exterior, having two glowing teal eyes and a hinged jaw and mouth, but with two insect-like mandibles. He wears (relatively) small decorative ornaments on his upper arms and central tail.\nSkarner is a commanding and imposing presence, speaking with the authority of an ancient, powerful being. Still, he carries an aura of formality, wisdom, and solemnity. He is single-mindedly protective of Ixtal , seeing himself as its steward and most important protector. Though he cares greatly for mortals, he is keenly aware of their flaws and weaknesses, seemingly having little faith in them. Thus, he is extremely stubborn, prioritizing his own judgment above that of all others. He is absolutely certain that Ixtal should remain in isolation and is growing increasingly paranoid as more Ixtali begin to question their nation's solitude.\nSkarner views Milio negatively and sees him as an extension of his great aunt, who rebelled against the Yun Tal. [ 2 ]\nSkarner is aware of Qiyana's plot to seize power. Presumably, he disapproves."}

He was one of the founding members of the Yun Tal , a ruling caste dedicated to leading the Ixtali to a brighter future.\nAs the protector of Ixtal, Skarner listened to the earth's vibrations for any threats to the nation, the most concerning being the encroaching Shuriman Empire. Eventually, the forces of Shurima would arrive at Ixtal and offered them an opportunity to form an alliance. The Yun Tal accepted, despite Skarner's protest, due his distrust of their lust for power. After Shurima collapsed as the result of the Icathian rebellion, Ixtal had regained its independence, but Skarner was left distrustful towards the world outside Ixtal. His fears worsened after witnessing the destruction caused by the Rune Wars , eventually convincing the Yun Tal to isolate Ixtal from the rest of the world. Left bitter towards the Yun Tal's failure to protect Ixtal, he decided that he would be Ixtal's sole protector, creating an underground chamber beneath Ixaocan to amplify the vibrational threads around the continent so he could always sense any potential threats. Eventually, he decided to stay in his chamber permanently, but as newer generations of Ixtali started to question their civilization's self-isolation, Skarner's paranoia began to grow. Believing that ending their isolation would lead to disastrous consequences for Ixtal, Skarner swore to protect Ixtal no matter the cost, even if it meant their destruction.\nSkarner is a kaiju-sized scorpion-like creature with six legs, a pair of thick grasping pincers, and three long tails ending in stingers. He has a teal and white carapace decorated with orange, teal, and white paint. His head is vaguely human-like despite its chitinous exterior, having two glowing teal eyes and a hinged jaw and mouth, but with two insect-like mandibles. He wears (relatively) small decorative ornaments on his upper arms and central tail.\nSkarner is a commanding and imposing presence, speaking with the authority of an ancient, powerful being. Still, he carries an aura of formality, wisdom, and solemnity. He is single-mindedly protective of Ixtal , seeing himself as its steward and most important protector. Though he cares greatly for mortals, he is keenly aware of their flaws and weaknesses, seemingly having little faith in them. Thus, he is extremely stubborn, prioritizing his own judgment above that of all others. He is absolutely certain that Ixtal should remain in isolation and is growing increasingly paranoid as more Ixtali begin to question their nation's solitude.\nSkarner views Milio negatively and sees him as an extension of his great aunt, who rebelled against the Yun Tal. [ 2 ]\nSkarner is aware of Qiyana's plot to seize power. Presumably, he disapproves."}

Her genteel manner has endeared her to the Demacian nobility, though some speculate her arresting melodies actually emanate magic—a dangerous prospect in the kingdom. Silent to outsiders but understood easily enough by close companions, Sona plucks her harmonies not only to soothe injured allies, but also to strike down unsuspecting enemies.\nSona was left in a monastery as an infant in the Ionia province of Galrin . No other clue about her origins is known besides a mysterious magical instrument that was delivered with her. She has a close relationship with the other children in the monastery as they would seek comfort with her.\nShe was moved to Demacia with other children when Noxus started its invasion of Ionia , around 985 AN.  She was eventually adopted into the Buvelle noble house, who were art patrons of the nation, because they took interest in her musical abilities.\nSome years later, around the year 990 AN, her adoptive father was killed in the Battle of the Gates of Mourning . The family mourned, so Lestara took Sona back to Ionia , so she could understand more of herself.\nAt some point, Sona would aid Ryze against the Navori Brotherhood so he could gather a World Rune.\nWhen Sona perceived the animosity and disunion that struck the First Lands, she decided that there was no place for her in Ionia anymore and she went back to Demacia with her mother.\n(TBA)\nSona is a slender, pale-skinned woman with long blue hair and yellow at the ends. Her robes is a long, elegant gown with a distinctive palette of blue, dark blue, turquoise and gold. The most characteristic ornaments of her attire are the golden diadem on her head between her hair. She also has an Etwahl that floats along with her.\nSona is a very graceful and elegant young woman. She best (and primarily) expresses herself through her music (although she also as the ability to express her thoughts and communicate with others via telepathic speech), which is best known for it's melodious nature. This highly reflects her gracious and refined personality. Sona is a very caring and gentle woman who helps out others in need and comforts those in need.\nSona is the adoptive daughter of 2 Lord Barrett and Lady Lestara from House Buvelle, and adopted sister of Kahina. She is very close to all of them, especially her mother Lestara. They also know that she is magical and protect her from the Mageseekers .\nSona met Irelia at some point when she came back to Ionia\nShe met Taric before his exile.\nDuring the events of Call of Power , Sona traveled with Ryze to the Hirana Monastery after the Noxian invasion and fought the Navori Brotherhood who ambushed them."}

Her genteel manner has endeared her to the Demacian nobility, though some speculate her arresting melodies actually emanate magic—a dangerous prospect in the kingdom. Silent to outsiders but understood easily enough by close companions, Sona plucks her harmonies not only to soothe injured allies, but also to strike down unsuspecting enemies.\nSona was left in a monastery as an infant in the Ionia province of Galrin . No other clue about her origins is known besides a mysterious magical instrument that was delivered with her. She has a close relationship with the other children in the monastery as they would seek comfort with her.\nShe was moved to Demacia with other children when Noxus started its invasion of Ionia , around 985 AN.  She was eventually adopted into the Buvelle noble house, who were art patrons of the nation, because they took interest in her musical abilities.\nSome years later, around the year 990 AN, her adoptive father was killed in the Battle of the Gates of Mourning . The family mourned, so Lestara took Sona back to Ionia , so she could understand more of herself.\nAt some point, Sona would aid Ryze against the Navori Brotherhood so he could gather a World Rune.\nWhen Sona perceived the animosity and disunion that struck the First Lands, she decided that there was no place for her in Ionia anymore and she went back to Demacia with her mother.\n(TBA)\nSona is a slender, pale-skinned woman with long blue hair and yellow at the ends. Her robes is a long, elegant gown with a distinctive palette of blue, dark blue, turquoise and gold. The most characteristic ornaments of her attire are the golden diadem on her head between her hair. She also has an Etwahl that floats along with her.\nSona is a very graceful and elegant young woman. She best (and primarily) expresses herself through her music (although she also as the ability to express her thoughts and communicate with others via telepathic speech), which is best known for it's melodious nature. This highly reflects her gracious and refined personality. Sona is a very caring and gentle woman who helps out others in need and comforts those in need.\nSona is the adoptive daughter of 2 Lord Barrett and Lady Lestara from House Buvelle, and adopted sister of Kahina. She is very close to all of them, especially her mother Lestara. They also know that she is magical and protect her from the Mageseekers .\nSona met Irelia at some point when she came back to Ionia\nShe met Taric before his exile.\nDuring the events of Call of Power , Sona traveled with Ryze to the Hirana Monastery after the Noxian invasion and fought the Navori Brotherhood who ambushed them."}

She endeavors to spread the virtues of compassion and mercy to everyone she meets—even healing those who would wish harm upon her. And, for all Soraka has seen of this world's struggles, she still believes the people of Runeterra have yet to reach their full potential.\nAs the Starchild and one celestial being, Soraka and the inhabitants of the celestial realm watch the mortal realm and regarded the fledgling races of Runeterra with growing concern. The guidance and fates that had been woven into the night sky often went unseen—or worse, were misinterpreted by their simple mortal minds, leading to chaos, uncertainty, and suffering.\nNo longer able to merely watch, Soraka chose to descend to the mortal realm, determined to untangle the knots in the tapestry of the world.\nAnd so Soraka came to be, and set upon her journey to soothe the mortals she encountered.\nSoraka quickly learned the capacity for cruelty that the peoples of Runeterra possessed. Whether on the battlefields of inescapable conflicts, in the seedy underbellies of sprawling cities, or on the frontiers of the untamed wilderness beyond them, there seemed to be no end to the fighting, betrayal, and suffering Soraka witnessed. She watched, helpless, as mortals ignorantly broke the threads of destiny they could have woven together. Their lives were too short, she reasoned. They were simply unable to see the greater patterns, now lost.\nBut as Soraka lived among them, as one of them, trying to repair what little of the damage she could... something incredible and wholly unforeseen happened.\nSoraka noticed a new, unintended design emerging—intertwined, and of a staggering complexity.\nUnintended and wild, the mortals were forging new and unknown futures for themselves. From the celestial realm above, it had seemed like pure chaos; but with her new perspective, and blessed by the stars to stand against the erosion of time, Soraka now beheld an almost perfect beauty. Just as mortals had the deepest capacity for cruelty, so too did they possess infinite potential for kindness, and inspiration to rival anything among the stars.\nSoraka realized her place was not to repair or replicate the celestial pattern. While a part of her craved the fixed, comforting destinies of the stars, she knew in her heart that static fates could not contain the unbridled, dynamic potential of mortality.\nAnd so her work took on renewed vigor, driven to unlock the untapped possibilities of all she met. Soraka sought now to inspire and guide rather than shepherd, to see what unblazed trails each mortal would discover for themselves in their brief, radiant moment.\nStar Spring of the Astral Grove .\nOver the millennia, legends of the Starchild have filtered through all the lands of Runeterra. Some tribes of the Freljord still speak of a far wanderer, a horned healer who soothed the icy bite of the most brutal winters. In the depths beneath Zaun , rumors float of a lilac skinned medic who would purify weary lungs from the ravages of the alchemical Gray. In troubled Ionia , the oldest myths of the Vastayashai'rei recall a seer who communed with the stars themselves, and called upon their light both to heal the wounded and scorch those who would do further harm to the First Lands.\nCurrently, Soraka calls the westernmost peaks of Targon , Astral Grove her home. There she created 2 Star Spring a huge source of healing waters where she watches over an isolated tribe of vastaya , teaching them her healing ways, and tending quietly to her own needs as well as shepherding Stellacorns , alicorn creatures that fall from the celestial realm. They would aid them until maturity when they would send them back to the celestial realm—though what brings her so close to the great mountain, or how long she will stay, only Soraka knows.\nMany times, she has watched entire civilizations dance close to the brink of destruction, and she has learned that she cannot save those who do not wish it, nor force them to see what they will not.\nAll the same, Soraka is determined never to stop trying.\nSoraka meets a little Rakkor girl who in the middle of the night was trying to climb the summit of Mount Targon to prove to her family that she was not \"weak\". Soraka then tells her about A young woman with pale hair . Her counterpart, a woman whose face burned as brightly as the sun . And a warrior with a spear .\n“All of these mortals ascended to the peak. But they had chosen that path with all their soul.” She turned to the girl and spoke slowly, taking no delight in her words. “You have not truly chosen the mountain. And Targon will not choose you. You would walk to your death. Don’t do this.”\nthen calling the girl to warm up and have tea, where she could leave at dawn, not to climb the mountain, but to start over and find a new path in her life.\nA Vastaya named Kalan travels to Fae'lor Castle, home of Dael'eh Ahira, or the Dreaming Pool, a spiritually magical pool that previously imprisoned Syndra . After an accident, Kalan eventually freed Syndra , Kalan knelt, motionless and silent, as he waited for seer to speak. Soraka told Kalan about Fae'lor and their possible future fates.\nCurrently, Kalan is imprisoned in Dael'eh Ahira, or Lake of Dreams.\nSoraka is a celestial being slender of lilac skinned, long pale blonde hair with a single horn on the forehead, golden eyes and with goat-like legs. She wears simple wanderer outfits with a distinct palette of red, orange and some brown touches, including her cape. The most distinctive ornament on her attire is the 1 Gems adornments. It also has a golden Celestial Staff shaped like a moon at the tip. While having the appearance of the ottrani , Soraka only took the form of one, with her one horn being a key distinction from the vastayans .\nSoraka is a very kind and humble individual, but she is also extremely protective and caring for those who follow her and who rely on her guidance . She is faithful to her cause in wanting to help those in need and always seeks to help those who seek help.\nDespite this, Soraka believes in free will above everything else. Although she offers guidance, the offered must accept being guided and healed for her to be capable of helping. She offers numerous paths to mortals, but only they may choose the way they will walk.\nSoraka, being a celestial being, knows about Aurelion Sol and seems to know him personally. While Aurelion sees Soraka as having lowered herself, she disagrees with him and sees beauty in being in the mortal world.\nPantheon once told Soraka \"If only your kind could see what you see, Soraka, they would weep for you as you weep for us.\"\nSoraka refers to Pantheon as Warrior with a spear and he refers her as The Seer, Soraka once designed the Pantheon in a constellation of stars.\nTaric is quite generous to Soraka, for example, when Soraka tells him \"Your star shines brightly.\" and he replies \"There is no one as brilliant as you.\" Both seem to share the vision of looking to mortals with kindness when Soraka says \"This world has great potential\". and Taric nods, saying \"Each life is uniquely faceted.\"\nSoraka knows the pain of the Lunari twins, but tells them not to feel it. what Alune considers would be to deny her and her brother their existence.\nDiana met a Celestial being descending from the Astral Grove . Soraka refers to Diana as the Pale-haired Woman/Sable-haired Girl\nSoraka refers to Leona as Woman whose face burned like the sun\nDuring their climb on top of Mount Targon, Tyari would meet the starchild which would give them assurance for their efforts.\nSoraka personally knows the Arbiter of the Peak and is on good terms with him.\nSoraka watches over an isolated tribe of vastaya , teaching them her healing ways, and tending quietly to her own needs as well as shepherding stellacorns , alicorn creatures that fall from the celestial realm. She is a mentor to all in the tribe like Illi , 3 Hakan , 4 Lidari , and 4 Vin ."}

Though he was cast down and debilitated in the Ionian wars, his left arm severed, he seized control of the empire with ruthless determination... and a new, demonic hand. Now, Swain commands from the front lines, marching against a coming darkness that only he can see—in glimpses gathered by shadowy ravens from the corpses all around him. In a swirl of sacrifice and secrets, the greatest secret of all is that the true enemy lies within.\nJericho Swain was born into an affluent Noxian family, among the established houses that trace shortly after the nation's founding. They were also favored by the emperor of Noxus― Boram Darkwill ―having been instrumental in his rise to the throne.\nYet House Swain was also among many that hungered for power, and as such were part of a secret cabal called the Black Rose . His parents were especially intent on finding some dark power hidden in the depths of the Immortal Bastion , that which eluded discovery for many years as it cackled in the darkness like a raven's caw.\nThe cabal had aided Darkwill's political rise, but in time he rejected their influence thereafter. LeBlanc , head matriarch of the Black Rose, manipulated Swain as a young nobleman into revealing the Black Rose and executing its most prominent members, including Swain's own parents and Leblanc herself. However, LeBlanc's execution was a deception, and she retreated back into the shadows of Noxus to wait for an opportunity to strike. For exposing the corruption, Swain was granted a commission in the Noxian army, where he would serve for years to come.\nSwain learned firsthand that the empire's true strength was upheld not by pure Noxian ferocity, but by all its people united in spite of their origins. Nobles and foreign slaves alike were all seen as soldiers on the front lines.\nSwain had carved out his career in securing the western borders, as well as expanding into Shurima . But in time, the aging emperor grew more paranoid and unhinged over his own mortality. Fighting wars on too many fronts, lusting over magical relics; greed became the clear motivation of the regime.\nDuring the invasion of Ionia , Darkwill retasked much of the warbands to hunt for artifacts that could extend mortal lifespan, With Swain's forces depleted, it became nearly impossible to engage the enemy. At the Battle of the Placidium , his troops were overrun in what should have been an ambush. Swain was gravely wounded with his knee shattered and his arm cut off . On the verge of death, he felt a familiar darkness press upon him again as a raven approached to feed; but he would not let it take him. Staring into the bird's eyes, he saw a vision of the dark truth: that LeBlanc had seduced Darkwill with promises of extending his life, and had sent Swain to die. It was not the raven that told him this, but something deeper. This was the great power that Swain's parents had been looking for, and now he knew it could be found.\nReturning to Noxus, Swain was disgraced and regarded as nothing more than a cripple. Through his fragile state, Swain set about in search of that strange power, that which cackled in the darkness like a raven's caw. What he found was Raum, an ancient entity that preyed on the dying and consumed their secrets. But the man solved a puzzle even the demon did not anticipate: a way to wield its power.\nSwain had physically restored himself and could use magic to defeat his enemies, along with using Raum to listen to the secrets of the dying. Over the course of many years, Swain amassed power, allies, and elaborate plans to kill Darkwill. In the end, it only took one night to capture the throne. Swain revealed himself to all of Noxus, leaving Darkwill dead and the throne empty. In its place, he established the Trifarix: a council of 3 members to take over the responsibilities of the emperor. Together they embody Noxus' core values, with Swain representing Vision, Darius exemplifying Might, and The Faceless one embodying Guile. This Council was made so that no one man could rule Noxus, and if one were to divert from the foundations of strength that Noxus was built on, the other two would be able to keep them in check. Moreover, this insurance would counterbalance Swain should he ever befall to demonic corruption.\nSwain immediately pulled back the Noxian forces from Darkwill's untenable ventures. He also held conventions detailing his plans for the empire, pardoning the noble houses that swore fealty, and allowing dissenting houses to safely leave the empire. A large part of the dissent was over the new policies that grated traditional power systems such as inherited lordship, personal wealth, and ownership of human property. [ 1 ]\nSeeing areas of concern abroad and within, Swain sent one of the empire's best assassins in an almost impossible task. [ 2 ] Katarina was assigned to kill the Demacian king Jarvan III , as well as her own father Marcus Du Couteau , who has suspected ties with the Black Rose. However, Marcus intercepted the written order and managed to deter her long enough to get close to destroying Swain. The Grand General intervened in the final duel and backfired the implosive weapon to destroy Marcus instead. He then congratulates Katarina on her success and revealed that the assignment was a test to find an assassin that could eliminate Swain in the event that he becomes corrupt.\nSecessionists held the mineral-rich Rokrund Plains , crafting explosives that deterred Noxian forces from advancing. This prompted Swain to visit the campaign generals and discuss strategy. One of these was General Brannin Granth , a secret operative of the Black Rose that plotted to kill Swain. Within the meeting, he proclaimed that the battle was unwinnable without death and revealed an explosive fuse ready to blow. Swain chuckled at the profound suggestion, agreeing that while the soldiers may die anyway, their sacrifice makes way for a greater reinforcement. He then reveals his demon arm and quickly strangles Granth. \"Granth and I... we always look for what must be sacrificed in order to win.\"\nSeven years into the Trifarix rule, delegates Oram and Alyssa from the Delverhold approached the council to negociate concessions in response to a local crisis. The mineral export quotas became unsustainable with the dwindling reserves in the Ironspike mines, sinking the people into poverty. Furthermore, Oram argued that their treaty to the empire had been invalidated with the death of the emperor, which permits the Delverhold to extricate from the empire if necessary. While Swain agreed to hear the terms, Darius argued that there was no compelling bargain.\nSome days go by, and the delegates attempted to seize and extort the Faceless One for their vote. But in a deceptive trap, Oram is killed by Alyssa and she is quickly captured by the guards. She is brought before the Trifarix, whom were fully aware of the extortion, but recognize her disaffection in the Delverhold. Swain candidly stated that the Trifarix did not want to encourage other provinces to make demands as well. Alyssa said that she knew the Delverhold governor would use the delegates' deaths to justify secession, but returning Delverhold to the kingdom rule would be a grave mistake long-term. She then suggested to become governor herself in order to maintain relations with Noxus. The council agree to the idea and sent a Trifarian entourage with her back to Delverhold to claim office.\nSwain is a fair skinned man with long, white hair. He wears black armor, black pants, and a black coat. His left arm was restored with the power of Raum, and consequently glows a shade of red.\nSwain is cold and calculating, often seeing people's lives as pieces in a bigger game. He is a master tactician and general, able to predict his enemies' next move with his cunning intellect and win battles swiftly and efficiently. Swain does not often act in his own interests, rather doing whatever is best for Noxus, as he knows that the empire is much more important than him, and he is committed to returning it back to its foundations and making sure that it outlasts him.\nIrelia cut off Swain's left arm during the Battle of the Placidium.\nSwain and Darius are two of the three heads of the Trifarix of Noxus , embodying the Noxian values of Vision and Might respectively, along with The Faceless One, who embodies Guile.\nAs one of many Noxian nobles that are negatively affected by Swain's coup, Ambessa strongly detests Swain for his rule in overthrowing the old Emperor, Boram Darkwill as well as establishing the Triferian Council. She often scornfully calls him as the \"Usurper\" or \"A Man with only vision but no Foresight\". She also refers him as a Raven and herself as a wolf, indicating that she thinks his rule weakens Noxus.\nWhen audiences for the Reckoning arenas waned and Draven fell into a drunk stupor, Swain found him and offered him a role in his coup against Boram Darkwill. He became integral to Swain’s plan, killing Darkwill himself. He is considered a close ally by Swain.\nKatarina serves as an assassin for the Trifarix council, killing people at their command. It is also hinted that Swain may know what happened to her father.\nUrgot was sent away from Noxus to Zaun as a part of Swain's coup, as he was seen as a liability and a potential threat to Swain's plan.\nIt is likely that Raum worked for Mordekaiser or was used by him, as Swain found Raum in the Immortal Bastion .\nGangplank stole The Leviathan, Swain's personal warship and the head of the Noxian fleet. Because of this, Swain despises Gangplank and wishes to see his demise.\nSwain has close ties with the Black Rose . The organization is currently trying to either control Swain or kill him in order to take the throne from him. Swain knows this and is trying to take down the organization, but knows that it is unlikely that he will accomplish this goal.\nSwain considers LeBlanc, the head matriarch of the Black Rose, as his rival. Swain and LeBlanc's personal relationship is vague, and they may have been lovers at some point. [ 3 ] When Boram Darkwill first took the throne and refused help from the Black Rose, LeBlanc, unbeknownst to Swain, manipulated Swain into revealing the Black Rose and making it look like she was executed and the Black Rose was dead. [ 4 ]\nSwain obtained Sion from the Black Rose after the organization left Sion in his own tomb for years. Swain now uses him as a living weapon to use against his enemies."}

As a boy, his ability to root out hidden sorcery caught the attention of the notorious mageseekers , who eventually imprisoned him for turning those same powers against them. Having now broken free, Sylas lives as a hardened revolutionary, using the magic of those around him to destroy the kingdom he once served… and his band of outcast mage followers seems to grow by the day.\nSylas of Dregbourne was born in Demacia , where he developed magical abilities at a young age. As per the typical Demacian belief that magic was an affliction, Sylas' parents convinced him to turn himself in to the Mageseekers . The Mageseekers took notice of Sylas' ability to sense the magic within people, so they used his power to identify the mages within the city. But Sylas began to notice the prominence of mages living their lives as civilians, having to live with being labeled as criminals by Demacian society, which caused him to doubt his standing within Demacia.\nOne day, Sylas and his Mageseeker handlers found a young mage girl in the countryside, forced to live in hiding to avoid persecution. Sylas took pity on her due to being so young so he tried to protect her from his handlers, but he accidentally brushed against her skin, causing Sylas to fire her lightning magic uncontrollably, resulting in the deaths of the girl as well as two Mageseekers. Sylas tried to evade the law, but he was labelled as the most dangerous mage alive and when he was caught, he was sentenced to imprisonment for life.\nWith his hands chained by petricite shackles, Sylas was imprisoned in a Mageseeker compound for fifteen years, growing disillusioned and vengeful towards the kingdom and seeking its downfall. One day, Luxanna Crownguard of the Crownguard House found him in the compound and sympathized with him for his plight, with both soon forming a steady bond. While Lux visited Sylas to teach him about the world outside his cell and gave him books to read, and in exchange he taught her how to control her magic. One of the books Sylas recieved was Galio 's blueprint by Durand, where he learned about the true properties of petricite and how it did not nullify magic, but accumulate it until it reached its breaking point. All he needed to do now was touch Lux to absorb her magic into his shackles and break free.\nEventually, the Crownguards found out about Lux's meetings with Sylas, so he was sentenced to public execution by sword. Lux intervened by telling the crowd by advocating for Sylas' rights, but he touched her and unleashed a powerful blast of Lux's magic, killing everyone on scene except Lux.\nFreed from the authorities, Sylas used his powers to destroy the Mageseeker compound and free the imprisoned mages to start a revolution against Demacia for their persecution of mages. He led them to the royal castle to capture 7 King Jarvan III and publicly humiliate him, but to his surprise the king had already been killed before he arrived. His son, Prince Jarvan IV , blamed Sylas and the mages for causing the death of his father, while Sylas decided to humiliate him instead. Sylas tied Jarvan IV to a chair and forced him to eat a rat to reflect the terrible conditions experienced by the prisoners of the compound, but Lux came to stop him, with her magic suppressed after drinking a petricite mixture. She shot a crossbow at Sylas and stabbed him in the foot before releasing Jarvan IV.\nThe Dauntless Vanguard arrived in time, led by Lux's brother Garen Crownguard . Lux warned Garen to avoid letting Sylas touch his petricite armaments, so Garen grabbed an axe to strike him. Sylas counterattacked Garen by absorbing the magic of one of his downed allies, but Jarvan IV put him at a chokehold to avenge his father. Sylas was outnumbered by the Demacian army, so he told his allies to retreat into the sewers to escape Demacia. As he began to leave, Lux tried to warn the mages not to follow him, but he told them that there was no need to worry about her because she wouldn't hurt an innocent.\nDue to Jarvan IV blaming Sylas' revolution for the death of King Jarvan III, he enforced a zero-tolerance policy towards magic in Demacia, causing innocent mages in Demacia to be sentenced to merciless treatment by the Mageseekers. Out of desperation, some mages planned to flee Demacia to migrate to Sylas' camp so they would be safe.\n(TBA)\n(TBA) Sylas teamed up with the Winter's Claw to fight against Garen and his sister, Lux , as well as other Demacian soldiers.

When he was younger, he initially wanted to protect his fellow mages from being harmed by his Mageseeker associates, but after the incident which got him imprisoned, Sylas grew to resent the kingdom after fifteen years of imprisonment. After being freed, he took on the role of a martyr for his fellow mages, inspiring them to join his rebellion. His initial goal was to raze Demacia to the ground, with no prospect of the aftermath. Despite his devotion to his cause, he harboured deep remorse towards his betrayal of Lux.\nDuring his revolution against the Mageseekers, Sylas gradually developed a change of heart thanks to Leilani's influence, letting go of his desire for vengeance and learning to value his fellow rebels, even being more merciful towards his enemies. He was heavily affected by the deaths of the allies that he had lost on the way, striving to become a better leader for their sake. After achieving victory, Sylas split his alliance with the Demacians and started fighting against them again, believing that because the Demacian government would enable an ideology like the Mageseekers to happen, mages would never be truly free until the monarchy is abolished.\nSylas was abducted by the Mageseekers at a very young age and had his magic detection abilities used to find and capture other mages. After an incident where Sylas ended up killing two mageseekers by accident to protect a little girl, he fled to the wilderness.

He would harbor great resentment of his captors as they would treat him like an animal and barely give him any food.\nSylas formed a bond with Lux while he was imprisoned. In exchange for information of the outside world, he would teach her to control her magic due to magic being outlawed in Demacia. He later manipulated her and used her power to escape. He would eventually make amends with her and come to her aid when the mageseekers attacked her mages settlement. While Lux has not forgotten Sylas' betrayal, she undestands he is more than just a murderer.\nAfter escaping his execution, Sylas and his followers fought Garen .

As a child, she disturbed the village elders with her reckless and wild magic. She was sent away to be taught greater control, but eventually discovered her supposed mentor was restraining her abilities. Forming her feelings of betrayal and hurt into dark spheres of energy, Syndra has sworn to destroy all who would try to control her.\nSyndra was born in Navori, Ionia, within a small village. She possessed a distracted nature, causing her parents to frequently punish her. Each time she was punished, Syndra sought solace in her secret hideout - the Spectral Willow. There, she confided her sorrows to the tree in cries and whispers, finding refuge in its roots.\nHowever, one fateful day, Syndra's brother, Evard, and his friends discovered her hideout and began taunting her. Despite her efforts to disregard them, one of Evard's friends threw mud at her, drawing blood and igniting a fierce rage within the young, tormented girl. Three luminous orbs materialized around Syndra, causing the willow tree to wither and Evard and his friends to flee. Syndra's village, reliant on the willow tree for its magical essence, blamed Syndra's family for its demise, resulting in their eventual exile.\nFollowing their exile from Navori, Syndra and her family traversed Ionia for days until reaching Fae'lor, a renowned magic school of Syndra's time specializing in the taming of wild magic. Faced with limited alternatives, Syndra's parents made the decision for her to remain at the school to refine her magic.\nInitially content in her pursuit of magical knowledge, Syndra eventually grew frustrated as she sensed a waning in her abilities over time. She confronted Konigen, her teacher, who then revealed that Syndra's extraordinary magical prowess had compelled him to seal her powers. Shocked by this revelation, Syndra reproached her teacher for this betrayal. Her rage overwhelmed her once more, causing her to unleash a sphere of energy at her teacher, killing him.\nConsumed by immense pain and loneliness, Syndra ascended into the sky, summoning three orbs of energy that sapped the spiritual essence of Fae'lor.

As a child, she disturbed the village elders with her reckless and wild magic. She was sent away to be taught greater control, but eventually discovered her supposed mentor was restraining her abilities. Forming her feelings of betrayal and hurt into dark spheres of energy, Syndra has sworn to destroy all who would try to control her.\nSyndra was born in Navori, Ionia, within a small village. She possessed a distracted nature, causing her parents to frequently punish her. Each time she was punished, Syndra sought solace in her secret hideout - the Spectral Willow. There, she confided her sorrows to the tree in cries and whispers, finding refuge in its roots.\nHowever, one fateful day, Syndra's brother, Evard, and his friends discovered her hideout and began taunting her. Despite her efforts to disregard them, one of Evard's friends threw mud at her, drawing blood and igniting a fierce rage within the young, tormented girl. Three luminous orbs materialized around Syndra, causing the willow tree to wither and Evard and his friends to flee. Syndra's village, reliant on the willow tree for its magical essence, blamed Syndra's family for its demise, resulting in their eventual exile.\nFollowing their exile from Navori, Syndra and her family traversed Ionia for days until reaching Fae'lor, a renowned magic school of Syndra's time specializing in the taming of wild magic. Faced with limited alternatives, Syndra's parents made the decision for her to remain at the school to refine her magic.\nInitially content in her pursuit of magical knowledge, Syndra eventually grew frustrated as she sensed a waning in her abilities over time. She confronted Konigen, her teacher, who then revealed that Syndra's extraordinary magical prowess had compelled him to seal her powers. Shocked by this revelation, Syndra reproached her teacher for this betrayal. Her rage overwhelmed her once more, causing her to unleash a sphere of energy at her teacher, killing him.\nConsumed by immense pain and loneliness, Syndra ascended into the sky, summoning three orbs of energy that sapped the spiritual essence of Fae'lor. She unleashed devastation upon the entire island, indiscriminately eliminating anyone in her path. This prompted the intervention of the Spirit of Ionia.\nThe spirit created a rift in the earth, restraining Syndra with thick vines and pulling her into the crevice.

She has crossed nearly all of Valoran on a journey to learn the true nature of her growing powers, though more recently she has returned to protect her tribe. Some have mistaken her compassion for weakness and paid the ultimate price—for beneath Taliyah's youthful demeanor is a will strong enough to move mountains, and a spirit fierce enough to make the earth itself tremble.\nTaliyah was born in the south of Shurima, near the border of Icathia. Her tribe, the Naasaj, were nomadic weavers and herders. Though Taliyah was always taught to appreciate the desert's beauty, she was always most interested in the rock that lay underneath.\nAfter she turned six, Taliyah set off to find a young goat her father - the master shepherd and tribe chief - had placed in her hands. She followed the goatling through the night to a sheer cliff where it had become stuck. The stone of the cliff called to her as she lay a hand upon it, then erupted, bringing both goat and canyon wall down upon her. Her father brought her back to the camp and put her under the care of Babajan, the tribe's grandmother. Days later, she was finally able to explain what had happened, how the stone had called to her, but didn't mention that she had allowed it to fall. Babajan concluded that the Great Weaver watched over Taliyah, telling her parents that there was no reason to worry.\nOnce a child came of age in the Naasaj tribe, they performed a dance under the full moon - the face of the Great Weaver - to determine what their path in life would be based on their talents, and to apprentice them to a teacher. Taliyah, believing her power to be a curse, watched others use their own skills. When her time to dance finally came, she did not choose to become a weaver like her mother or herder like her father, instead closing her eyes and dancing with the stone. It rose up from the earth in a pillar, evoking startled cries from her kin. Her will broken, the rock crashed to the ground, cutting Taliyah's mother as she rushed to protect her daughter. To Taliyah, this was proof that she was indeed dangerous to everyone around her, and so she ran out into the night.\nHer father found her eventually, and Taliyah finally admitted her ability to shape the stone. Instead of being scared or revolted, though, he told her that she needed to face her power, not run from it. She returned to the circle with open eyes. This time, she wove with purpose, creating a memory of those she loved. When it was time for her mentor to stand, the entire tribe did, ready to stand with her. But Taliyah knew that her true teacher was not among them, and so she headed out into the world, promising to learn to control her power.\nBy now in her mid-teens, Taliyah headed west towards Targon , drawn towards the mountain by her natural affinity for stone. However, while in northern Shurima, it was a band of Noxians who discovered her. They promised her that Noxus celebrated such power, that she would find a teacher there. Raised to be trusting, Taliyah followed them, into the heart of Noxus. The endless political games were claustrophobic to her, until one captain promised to take her to Ionia , a place where she could practise her magic freely. But when they docked near a village and she was told to bury the inhabitants in their homes, Taliyah refused, and was tossed overboard to drown, which gave her a lifelong fear of drowning.\nAfter escaping the Noxians, Taliyah came across Yasuo , meditating in a shrine. She accidentally brought down an avalanche upon him, but managed to save him and bring him to a cave. He asked her why she had chosen such a path, causing her to leave the cave in frustration. While outside, Taliyah came face-to-face with an Ionian mountain lion. Learning a lesson from a little bird, Taliyah leaned into her power and crumbled the rock beneath both her and the lion. Yasuo saved her, becoming her unlikely mentor in the process. They had another harrowing encounter when some soldiers found them in an inn, accusing Yasuo of murder. With Taliyah's help, he fended them off and they escaped. Not long afterwards, they parted ways, but not before Yasuo told Taliyah to travel to the Freljord .\nTaliyah rushing home at the sight of The Sun Disc\nTaliyah returned to Shurima at around 17 years of age, passing through Bel'zhun and stopping in Vekaura. Outside the city, however, she found a dying Sivir , and decided to help her before going to find her family. While there, an army led by Xerath attacked Vekaura, looking for the heir to Azir's lineage - Sivir - in order to kill her. Nasus , who was also looking for Sivir, found them both and gave Sivir an amulet which would keep her hidden from Xerath, before going to fight the rogue Ascended. Taliyah managed to escape Vekaura with Sivir, but also protected Nasus and the survivors of the attack from Xerath's arcane missiles.\nWhile outrunning a sandstorm, Taliyah ended up right outside the Great City of Shurima, which had risen from the sands. She was ushered into the city to escape the sandstorm, which seemed too dangerous to withstand with the old Shuriman traditions. As she rested, she put a hand out to touch a city wall and was suddenly overwhelmed by memories locked within the stone. There was intense pain seared into the rock by tens of thousands of voices, the city's previous citizens. Azir's failed Ascension and Xerath's betrayal had killed all of them, in the same catastrophe which buried the city millennia ago.\nTaliyah spent a while in the desert, travelling with a group of other Shurimans whose families or homes had been destroyed by the Void, including 2 Rock Hopper , 4 Desert Naturalist and 3 Sai Scout . She considered them her new family. Her quest to find her tribe was complicated by the fact that the seasonal waters no longer flowed, so she could no longer predict their location. The group had decided to travel north to Xolun, a place they believed would be a safe haven from the Void.\nKai'Sa meets Taliyah\nWhen she sensed a person travelling underneath the earth, Taliyah resolved to follow and help them if she could. The person turned out to be Kai'Sa , who had been tracing a massive tunnel bored into the earth by an unknown voidborn. Taliyah managed to save Kai'Sa from a group of Lamplights, though didn't destroy them, and a pit collapse. They returned to Taliyah's camp to rest and eat, but Kai'Sa left the next day to continue following the tunnel underground, warning that the Xer'Sai would stop them before they got to Xolan . In fact, their route lay directly above the tunnel, and a little while later it collapsed into a massive pit, taking Samir (the 2 Rock Hopper ) with it. Taliyah got the other travellers to safety before diving in to save Samir. She found him, and helped Kai'Sa defeat the Lamplights using Kai'Sa's speed and her minefield of stone . Thanks to the other travelers, all three made it out alive. Kai'Sa was angry with Taliyah for not taking her advice earlier and pointed out that if the tunnel aligned with the route to Xolan , the town was likely already destroyed . Taliyah argued that they had managed to defeat the Lamplights together. They decided to try and reclaim Xolan from the Void, and so they parted ways with the group of travelers.\nTaliyah and Kai'Sa arrived in Xolan to find the town abandoned and destroyed. They were then attacked by a group of Xer'Sai , but fended them off before a sinkhole appeared in the ground. Rek'Sai emerged from the pit, and Kai'Sa lured her back underground. This allowed Taliyah to bring the statue of Xolaani, the 'faceless god', over the sinkhole to prevent Rek'Sai from re-emerging.\nTaliyah wears a red and gold Ionian coat with long sleeves over her lavender tunic, and a golden crown which keeps her hair in place. This crown was lost or destroyed during her travel to Xolun. She has brown eyes, thick eyebrows, light brown hair tied in a ponytail with two protruding strands braided, fringe, and a wide nose.\nTaliyah is a kind, compassionate young woman with a strong will. She is deeply devoted to her homeland and the people in it, dedicating herself to protecting them from both Shuriman and outside threats. Her confidence was bolstered by Yasuo, as he taught her how to control her power over stone. Her Myers-Briggs personality type is ENTJ ( 'the Commander' ). [ 2 ]\nYasuo became the teacher Taliyah had been looking for, as her people didn't understand her power, and Noxus sought to use her as a weapon. Before parting ways, Taliyah gave Yasuo the thread of handspun Shuriman wool with which he ties his hair back in-game. As an only child, Taliyah sees Yasuo as the older brother she never had. [ 3 ]\nHaving heard only rumors of both the Ancient Shuriman capital and Azir's rise from the sands, Taliyah is convinced he is a threat to her family and her homeland when nothing could be further from the truth .\nOn the way to find her family, Taliyah encountered a wounded Sivir and nurtured her.\nNasus encountered both of them when looking for Sivir in Vekaura . Taliyah was at first suspicious of his motives but later came to trust him. When Xerath and his army came to decimate the place and find Sivir , Nasus bought time for Taliyah to help others escape.\nAfter her return to Shurima, Taliyah met Kai'Sa and they fought the Voidborn together, including some of Rek'Sai's Xer'Sai . Taliyah parted way with the group she travelled with to join Kai'Sa in search of the mythical paradise, Xolan."}

He carved out a dangerous reputation on the brutal streets of Noxus , where he was forced to fight, kill, and steal to survive. Adopted by the notorious Du Couteau family, he now plies his deadly trade at the empire's command, assassinating enemy leaders, captains, and heroes… as well as any Noxian foolish enough to earn the scorn of their masters.\nTalon has no recollection of his family, nor of any warmth or kindness. He scraped out a living through his quick wits and deft thievery in the underbelly of Noxus. He learned to navigate the underground passages of Noxus and attained mastery of the blade. Marked as a threat by the empire, assassins were sent after him. He managed to kill his pursuers, dropping their bodies into Noxus’ moat.\nHowever, when General Du Couteau himself came after Talon, the Noxian General emerged victorious in the duel. He made an offer to Talon – to die or serve the Noxian High Command. Talon chose to live on the condition that he would serve the General alone because he could only respect orders from those he could not defeat.\n(TBA)\nTalon is a fair-skinned human man with dark hair and brown eyes. He is usually seen dressed as an assassin, with nearly his full body covered in blue cloth and light metal armor. This outfit features a large hood that shrouds his face and a decorative \"cape\" composed of five blades dangling from red ribbons. He also sometimes covers his nose and mouth with a cloth mask. His signature weapon is a large silver blade strapped to his right forearm.\nTalon is a cold and deadly perfectionist, valuing swift and clean kills above all else. He is obedient and efficient in his tasks, but despite his generally merciless approach, Talon believes his methodology is the best for all parties involved. In Talon's words, it's more merciful to give targets a quick, painless death than to draw it out, and it is both safer and more efficient for an assassin to avoid combat when possible.

He carved out a dangerous reputation on the brutal streets of Noxus , where he was forced to fight, kill, and steal to survive. Adopted by the notorious Du Couteau family, he now plies his deadly trade at the empire's command, assassinating enemy leaders, captains, and heroes… as well as any Noxian foolish enough to earn the scorn of their masters.\nTalon has no recollection of his family, nor of any warmth or kindness. He scraped out a living through his quick wits and deft thievery in the underbelly of Noxus. He learned to navigate the underground passages of Noxus and attained mastery of the blade. Marked as a threat by the empire, assassins were sent after him. He managed to kill his pursuers, dropping their bodies into Noxus’ moat.\nHowever, when General Du Couteau himself came after Talon, the Noxian General emerged victorious in the duel. He made an offer to Talon – to die or serve the Noxian High Command. Talon chose to live on the condition that he would serve the General alone because he could only respect orders from those he could not defeat.\n(TBA)\nTalon is a fair-skinned human man with dark hair and brown eyes. He is usually seen dressed as an assassin, with nearly his full body covered in blue cloth and light metal armor. This outfit features a large hood that shrouds his face and a decorative \"cape\" composed of five blades dangling from red ribbons. He also sometimes covers his nose and mouth with a cloth mask. His signature weapon is a large silver blade strapped to his right forearm.\nTalon is a cold and deadly perfectionist, valuing swift and clean kills above all else. He is obedient and efficient in his tasks, but despite his generally merciless approach, Talon believes his methodology is the best for all parties involved. In Talon's words, it's more merciful to give targets a quick, painless death than to draw it out, and it is both safer and more efficient for an assassin to avoid combat when possible. If a clean kill is not delivered immediately, Talon already considers that to be failure.\nTalon is shown to deeply value his family, taking on their name and greatly respecting Marcus and House Du Couteau. However, Talon's admiration and obedience to his father ultimately leads him down the path of resentment, as Talon desperately works to maintain Marcus Du Couteau's approval and comes to view himself as the rightful heir.

As a scout leader, nothing bad ever happens when Teemo’s around!\nTeemo had humble beginnings as a member of the Bandle Scouts and being the worst creature ever, rising up the ranks with his survival expertise. Travelling across the material realm to obtain Bandle Scout badges, Teemo earned countless achievements throughout his career, which led to him being promoted to the Bandle Scouts' new leader.

Once the custodian of countless arcane secrets, he sought a power greater than life or death, and now sustains himself by tormenting and breaking others with slow, excruciating inventiveness. His victims suffer far beyond their brief mortal coil as Thresh wreaks agony upon their souls, imprisoning them in his unholy lantern to torture for all eternity.\nThe wraith Thresh was born in the Blessed Isles as Erlok Grael, a monk of Helia . He served in the order for many years, expecting to be recognized among Helia's masters, but due to his humble background he was delegated to work as a warden to safeguard Helia's magical artifacts which he took as an insult. Grael felt bitter towards his new position as he believed himself more gifted than his noble-born peers who got more prestigious roles, and that his lowly position would stop him from being recognized. [ 1 ] After years of working in the vault, Grael grew bitter and cruel. Growing frustrated over his fellow wardens getting killed by the artifacts, he took interest in a nameless tome claimed to whisper one's darkest thoughts. Grael kept the tome in his possession, but his superior, Head Warden Rastofir, stopped him and threatened to demote him. Angered, he believed that Rastofir was trying to steal his research for his own benefit, so he arranged Rastofir to be killed by a miscategorized artifact so he could manipulate the order into a pragmatic direction. [ 2 ]\nOne day, a fleet of ships from Camavor invaded the Blessed Isles, led by their king Viego whom wanted to use the Waters of Life to resurrect his wife Isolde . When the monks refused, Hecarim and his knights took the opportunity to slaughter the monks and all of the natives. Grael delighted in the carnage and suffering that ensued, and took it upon himself to lead Viego to the Waters of Life. Isolde's resurrection failed and caused a blast of magic that corrupted the Blessed Isles' protective mist into the Black Mist, turning all of the inhabitants into wraiths . Grael embraced his transformation and took on the moniker Thresh, eager to act out his desires for cruelty without punishment or the limits of mortality. As decades passed, Thresh's spectral form morphed into a reflection of his darkest traits. He roamed the Shadow Isles killing people and imprisoning their souls within his lantern, becoming known in the folklore of Runeterra as a bogeyman figure.\nMany years later, Thresh encountered Lucian and Senna , a married couple of Sentinels of Light , in a forbidden Helian vault in search of a cure for the latter's curse. Overzealous in his goal to save Senna, Lucian refused to turn back, but his decision cost him Senna's life as she sacrificed herself to save him from an oncoming attack from Thresh. The wraith trapped her soul in his lantern, with Lucian spending years battling his arch-enemy, all while Thresh taunted him by holding Senna's soul ransom.\nEventually, Lucian was able to set Senna's soul free by blasting Thresh's lantern open.

He wore black armor on his feet and hands, but his clawed gauntlets glowed a spectral green. He carried a short-handled scythe in his right hand and was known to levitate his lantern with the left hand.

Fate Alias (es) The Card Master Characteristics Species Human ( Magical ) Pronoun (s) He/Him Timeline Born: 956 AN - 961 AN Weapon (s) Loaded Dice Blue Card Red Card Gold Card Personal status Status Alive Place of origin Serpentine River , The Jungle Current residence Unknown (No Fixed Abode) Romantic Intrest (s) Graves (Partner) Family Unnamed family Professional status Occupation (s) Thief Card Shark Swindler Mercenary Cutpurse Region (s) Bilgewater Champion Twisted Fate/LoL Related character (s) Graves Gangplank Miss Fortune Rafen Teemo Tristana Corki Lulu\nTwisted Fate is an infamous cardshark and swindler who has gambled and charmed his way across much of the known world, earning the enmity and admiration of the rich and foolish alike. He rarely takes things seriously, greeting each day with a mocking smile and an insouciant swagger. In every possible way, Twisted Fate always has an ace up his sleeve.\nBorn to the nomadic river folk of the Serpentine Delta, Tobias Felix quickly learned what it was to be an outsider. Tolerated for the exotic goods they peddled, but shunned for their strange traditions, his people found only short welcomes wherever they berthed their colorful river barques. His elders would shrug, and say this was just the way of the world, but the obvious prejudice always stuck in Tobias' craw.\nHe found his true calling in the gambling tents, between games of chance and skill like Mortwheel and Stabberscotch, when he first picked up a deck of playing cards. Many years earlier, his superstitious grandfather had shown him how to read omens in the shuffle and cut, while his aunt had later taught him how to read all an opponent's tells. Between the two, Tobias took to the high-stakes game of Krakenhand like an old master. He could almost feel each card's place in the deck, and follow their movements through each successive hand. He was often accused of cheating, but it was difficult for anyone to explain exactly how.\nFinally, one night, a group of men who'd lost their fortunes to young Tobias returned in the dead of night to settle the score. They came bearing cudgels and, emboldened by cheap rotgut, went from tent to tent in their search for him, beating down any of the river folk who got in their way. Fearing for his life, Tobias turned and fled into the darkness.\nWhen dawn came, the lad sheepishly crept back to find his people breaking down the camp. No one would look him in the eye. He had thought only of himself and left others to face the consequences of his actions.\nThough he begged and pleaded with them all, Tobias was exiled for what he had done. With his whole world falling apart around him, he watched helplessly as the barques left, leaving him alone on the riverbank with nothing but his grandfather's worn deck of cards clutched in his hands.\nHe grew to manhood as a drifter, trawling the gambling halls of every settlement he came to, using his preternatural skill to earn enough coin to survive. That Tobias was able to relieve the boastful, the arrogant, and the cruel of their cash was just an added bonus—though he was always careful to let his marks win at least a few hands, here and there.\nAcross one table, he met a deplorable fellow named Malcolm Graves.\nEach recognizing a kindred soul, Tobias and Graves quickly joined forces. On the southern borderlands of Valoran , they set two renowned noble houses of Noxus at each other’s throats as cover for the rescue of a kidnapped heir. That they pocketed the reward money, only to ransom the vile young man to the highest bidder, should really have come as no surprise to their original employer. In Piltover , they still hold the distinction of being the only thieves ever to crack the supposedly impenetrable Clockwork Vault. Not only did the pair empty the vault of all its treasures, they also tricked the guards into loading the loot onto their hijacked schooner, for a quick getaway through the Sun Gates.\nIn almost every case, only once they and their accomplices were safely over the horizon were their crimes even discovered—usually along with one of Twisted Fate’s trademark calling cards left where it would be easily found.\nWith every con, swindle, and heist, Tobias felt the pull of the cards growing stronger, and he knew it was more than mere gambler's luck that guided him. His people had always waved away concerns over primitive magic and “cartomancy”, but now Tobias began to seek out ever more dangerous means to bend the cards to his will.\nThat search ended badly Graves was taken alive and sent into The Locker while Tobias and the rest of the crew ran free. Though he tried to break Graves out, he failed. Instead, seeking to begin again, he returned his birth name to the river's waters and took another: Twisted Fate.\nIn the years after, Twisted Fate continued conning people solo, one-time evading capture by Miss Fortune. She would later hire him by proxy to sneak into Gangplank’s warehouse to steal and return a Crimson-Coil dagger, where he would reunite with Graves, who broke out from The Locker and was tipped off by the Bounty Hunter herself about Twisted Fate presence.\nFlamed with rage at his partner's apparent betrayal, Graves started shooting at Tobias in an effort to settle the score with him. With Gangplank's warehouse burning and with the pirate captain's thugs swarming, the resolution of Graves' and Twisted Fate's long-simmering feud threatens to engulf the entire city in flames. Informed by the destruction of his warehouse, Gangplank set off the catch both of the perpetrators of this act.\nBoth Graves and Twisted Fate tried to flee from the wrath of the Pirate King but with no success. Gangplank tortured them until he tried to publicly execute them in front of the whole city for their misbehavior. Hearing the news of this event, Sarah Fortune's plans set in motion and along with her crew, started to make preparations to blow up Gangplank’s flagship so all Bilgewater could witness the death of their Reaver King.\nGraves managed to hide one of Twisted Fate's cards, snatched during their previous fight around the city, from the pirate thugs, and so, Twisted Fate breaks free but Graves gets dragged to the bottom of the ocean. Twisted Fate then jumps after him and saves Graves from drowning but almost dies in the process. Graves manages to save Twisted Fate and after they successfully survive the explosion, both men settled their dispute and resolve to pick up their joint hustling.\nAs Graves had lost his shotgun Destiny, they head to Piltover so he can get a new one. Even though Graves and Twisted Fate are tempted to reconcile their relationship, both know it may take a while for Graves to completely trust Twisted Fate again, still, the latter is happy to have his old friend back.\nAfter running jobs in Piltover and Zaun for a while, they go back to Bilgewater in search of the Abyssal Crown. Along with the story, Twisted Fate actively tries to regain Graves' trust, staying despite the danger and giving the Crown to Graves since the latter still keeps some distance from him.\nThey end up angering a sea witch in the process. Later on Miss Fortune springs a trap for Twisted Fate and Graves. Despite the latter's success in cornering her, she manages to trap them and hand them to the sea witch in exchange for her quartermaster. In the end, she helps Twisted Fate and Graves escape as well.\nTwisted Fate is described as a tall, handsome male with tanned skin, trimmed beard and long dark hair. He's got sharp features and a strong jaw. He is usually depicted wearing a dandy wide-brimmed hat with golden ornaments along with a long black coat, a salmon vest, and a white button-up shirt with black tight pants and boots. Although he wears his hair loosely, in the Double-Double Cross cinematic he has shorter hair kept in a small ponytail and doesn’t wear his jacket.\nHis eye color remains inconsistent, being blue in some depictions and brown in others. T.F. also has a Bilgewater-themed tattoo on his right arm seen on his lore-based skin Cutpurse Twisted Fate .\nTwisted Fate rarely takes things seriously, greeting each day with a mocking smile and an insouciant swagger. He’s prone to brag and has an overall smug yet charismatic personality. He's an opportunistic and hedonistic person that enjoys the thrill of danger and adventure. However, he does seem to have some roguish honor, since he tends to steal mostly from rich people and it is mentioned that he enjoyed conning arrogant and cruel people, as shown in his short story. Even though he usually appears laid-back and playful, he rarely shows genuine emotions and has tight control of his expressions.\nTwisted Fate is analytical and a strategist, being the brains in his partnership with Graves, usually in charge of planning out heists. He’s also superstitious and theatrical, since it’s mentioned he enjoys putting on a show and communicates artistically at times.\nHe used to have a history of taking off when things started to get complicated but changed his ways after starting to work with Graves once again. Twisted Fate is also a stickler for appearance even having a “concerned face” he only uses when dealing with a really bad hand of cards or when he finds a new stain on his jacket. He’s very protective of his hat, to the point he checks the state of his hat first instead of his broken ribs after falling off a building. Twisted Fate is also plagued by the fact that he's a riverman that can't swim, drowning being his worst nightmare.\nTheir partnership started when they recognized a kindred soul in one another across a table during a high-stakes game in Mudtown.\nThey both shared the same reckless passion for danger and adventure, which is what encouraged them to form their partnership. Graves being the brawn, and T.F. being the brains they were an unusually effective team from the outset. Their mutual sense of roguish honor grew into genuine trust, and together they hustled across Valoran.\nThey were forced apart when a heist went south, with Graves getting sent to The Locker despite Twisted Fate’s efforts to save him. Graves endured years of torture and solitary confinement, during which time he nursed his bitter anger toward his old partner, and, convinced T.F. had betrayed him, Graves was determined to have his revenge.\nGraves reunited with T.F. again when Miss Fortune set them up, yet they were forced to put aside their differences in order to escape almost certain death in the ongoing conflict between her and Gangplank. Even though Graves and T.F. were tempted to reconcile their relationship, both knew it may take a while for Graves to completely trust T.F. again, still, the latter was happy to have his old friend back.\nHowever, since Graves still kept some distance from T.F., in the short story Destiny and Fate, T.F. proactively tries to show Graves that he can trust him again.

He rarely takes things seriously, greeting each day with a mocking smile and an insouciant swagger. In every possible way, Twisted Fate always has an ace up his sleeve.\nBorn to the nomadic river folk of the Serpentine Delta, Tobias Felix quickly learned what it was to be an outsider. Tolerated for the exotic goods they peddled, but shunned for their strange traditions, his people found only short welcomes wherever they berthed their colorful river barques. His elders would shrug, and say this was just the way of the world, but the obvious prejudice always stuck in Tobias' craw.\nHe found his true calling in the gambling tents, between games of chance and skill like Mortwheel and Stabberscotch, when he first picked up a deck of playing cards. Many years earlier, his superstitious grandfather had shown him how to read omens in the shuffle and cut, while his aunt had later taught him how to read all an opponent's tells. Between the two, Tobias took to the high-stakes game of Krakenhand like an old master. He could almost feel each card's place in the deck, and follow their movements through each successive hand. He was often accused of cheating, but it was difficult for anyone to explain exactly how.\nFinally, one night, a group of men who'd lost their fortunes to young Tobias returned in the dead of night to settle the score. They came bearing cudgels and, emboldened by cheap rotgut, went from tent to tent in their search for him, beating down any of the river folk who got in their way. Fearing for his life, Tobias turned and fled into the darkness.\nWhen dawn came, the lad sheepishly crept back to find his people breaking down the camp. No one would look him in the eye. He had thought only of himself and left others to face the consequences of his actions.\nThough he begged and pleaded with them all, Tobias was exiled for what he had done. With his whole world falling apart around him, he watched helplessly as the barques left, leaving him alone on the riverbank with nothing but his grandfather's worn deck of cards clutched in his hands.\nHe grew to manhood as a drifter, trawling the gambling halls of every settlement he came to, using his preternatural skill to earn enough coin to survive. That Tobias was able to relieve the boastful, the arrogant, and the cruel of their cash was just an added bonus—though he was always careful to let his marks win at least a few hands, here and there.\nAcross one table, he met a deplorable fellow named Malcolm Graves.\nEach recognizing a kindred soul, Tobias and Graves quickly joined forces. On the southern borderlands of Valoran , they set two renowned noble houses of Noxus at each other’s throats as cover for the rescue of a kidnapped heir. That they pocketed the reward money, only to ransom the vile young man to the highest bidder, should really have come as no surprise to their original employer. In Piltover , they still hold the distinction of being the only thieves ever to crack the supposedly impenetrable Clockwork Vault. Not only did the pair empty the vault of all its treasures, they also tricked the guards into loading the loot onto their hijacked schooner, for a quick getaway through the Sun Gates.\nIn almost every case, only once they and their accomplices were safely over the horizon were their crimes even discovered—usually along with one of Twisted Fate’s trademark calling cards left where it would be easily found.\nWith every con, swindle, and heist, Tobias felt the pull of the cards growing stronger, and he knew it was more than mere gambler's luck that guided him. His people had always waved away concerns over primitive magic and “cartomancy”, but now Tobias began to seek out ever more dangerous means to bend the cards to his will.\nThat search ended badly Graves was taken alive and sent into The Locker while Tobias and the rest of the crew ran free. Though he tried to break Graves out, he failed. Instead, seeking to begin again, he returned his birth name to the river's waters and took another: Twisted Fate.\nIn the years after, Twisted Fate continued conning people solo, one-time evading capture by Miss Fortune. She would later hire him by proxy to sneak into Gangplank’s warehouse to steal and return a Crimson-Coil dagger, where he would reunite with Graves, who broke out from The Locker and was tipped off by the Bounty Hunter herself about Twisted Fate presence.\nFlamed with rage at his partner's apparent betrayal, Graves started shooting at Tobias in an effort to settle the score with him. With Gangplank's warehouse burning and with the pirate captain's thugs swarming, the resolution of Graves' and Twisted Fate's long-simmering feud threatens to engulf the entire city in flames. Informed by the destruction of his warehouse, Gangplank set off the catch both of the perpetrators of this act.\nBoth Graves and Twisted Fate tried to flee from the wrath of the Pirate King but with no success. Gangplank tortured them until he tried to publicly execute them in front of the whole city for their misbehavior. Hearing the news of this event, Sarah Fortune's plans set in motion and along with her crew, started to make preparations to blow up Gangplank’s flagship so all Bilgewater could witness the death of their Reaver King.\nGraves managed to hide one of Twisted Fate's cards, snatched during their previous fight around the city, from the pirate thugs, and so, Twisted Fate breaks free but Graves gets dragged to the bottom of the ocean. Twisted Fate then jumps after him and saves Graves from drowning but almost dies in the process. Graves manages to save Twisted Fate and after they successfully survive the explosion, both men settled their dispute and resolve to pick up their joint hustling.\nAs Graves had lost his shotgun Destiny, they head to Piltover so he can get a new one. Even though Graves and Twisted Fate are tempted to reconcile their relationship, both know it may take a while for Graves to completely trust Twisted Fate again, still, the latter is happy to have his old friend back.\nAfter running jobs in Piltover and Zaun for a while, they go back to Bilgewater in search of the Abyssal Crown. Along with the story, Twisted Fate actively tries to regain Graves' trust, staying despite the danger and giving the Crown to Graves since the latter still keeps some distance from him.\nThey end up angering a sea witch in the process. Later on Miss Fortune springs a trap for Twisted Fate and Graves. Despite the latter's success in cornering her, she manages to trap them and hand them to the sea witch in exchange for her quartermaster. In the end, she helps Twisted Fate and Graves escape as well.\nTwisted Fate is described as a tall, handsome male with tanned skin, trimmed beard and long dark hair. He's got sharp features and a strong jaw. He is usually depicted wearing a dandy wide-brimmed hat with golden ornaments along with a long black coat, a salmon vest, and a white button-up shirt with black tight pants and boots. Although he wears his hair loosely, in the Double-Double Cross cinematic he has shorter hair kept in a small ponytail and doesn’t wear his jacket.\nHis eye color remains inconsistent, being blue in some depictions and brown in others. T.F. also has a Bilgewater-themed tattoo on his right arm seen on his lore-based skin Cutpurse Twisted Fate .\nTwisted Fate rarely takes things seriously, greeting each day with a mocking smile and an insouciant swagger. He’s prone to brag and has an overall smug yet charismatic personality. He's an opportunistic and hedonistic person that enjoys the thrill of danger and adventure. However, he does seem to have some roguish honor, since he tends to steal mostly from rich people and it is mentioned that he enjoyed conning arrogant and cruel people, as shown in his short story. Even though he usually appears laid-back and playful, he rarely shows genuine emotions and has tight control of his expressions.\nTwisted Fate is analytical and a strategist, being the brains in his partnership with Graves, usually in charge of planning out heists. He’s also superstitious and theatrical, since it’s mentioned he enjoys putting on a show and communicates artistically at times.\nHe used to have a history of taking off when things started to get complicated but changed his ways after starting to work with Graves once again. Twisted Fate is also a stickler for appearance even having a “concerned face” he only uses when dealing with a really bad hand of cards or when he finds a new stain on his jacket. He’s very protective of his hat, to the point he checks the state of his hat first instead of his broken ribs after falling off a building. Twisted Fate is also plagued by the fact that he's a riverman that can't swim, drowning being his worst nightmare.\nTheir partnership started when they recognized a kindred soul in one another across a table during a high-stakes game in Mudtown.\nThey both shared the same reckless passion for danger and adventure, which is what encouraged them to form their partnership. Graves being the brawn, and T.F. being the brains they were an unusually effective team from the outset. Their mutual sense of roguish honor grew into genuine trust, and together they hustled across Valoran.\nThey were forced apart when a heist went south, with Graves getting sent to The Locker despite Twisted Fate’s efforts to save him. Graves endured years of torture and solitary confinement, during which time he nursed his bitter anger toward his old partner, and, convinced T.F. had betrayed him, Graves was determined to have his revenge.\nGraves reunited with T.F. again when Miss Fortune set them up, yet they were forced to put aside their differences in order to escape almost certain death in the ongoing conflict between her and Gangplank. Even though Graves and T.F. were tempted to reconcile their relationship, both knew it may take a while for Graves to completely trust T.F. again, still, the latter was happy to have his old friend back.\nHowever, since Graves still kept some distance from T.F., in the short story Destiny and Fate, T.F. proactively tries to show Graves that he can trust him again. T.F. had a history of taking off when things got ugly and so, T.F. wanted to stay and retrieve the Abyssal Crown even if it meant risking his life so he could prove to Graves that he wouldn't leave him to pick up the pieces anymore. In the same story, when Graves shows up next to T.F. bleeding, the latter notices and expresses his concern, something that Graves actually appreciated even if he didn't say it out loud.\nDuring the Burning Tides events, T.F. jumps after Graves to save him from drowning despite not knowing how to swim and being terrified of drowning himself.\nGraves seems to like messing with T.F., particularly by calling him Tobias instead of Twisted Fate insisting the latter is a stupid name, or by splashing him with salt water just to mess with TF's carefully oiled and perfumed hair. Similarly, T.F. usually comes up with clever replies to annoy Graves. Their petty bickering is seen many times like at the end of Burning Tides, Double-double cross, and Destiny and Fate.\nIn the story \"The Boys and Bombolini\" it is revealed that both Graves and Twisted Fate have romantic feelings for each other.\nAfter some time, Graves captured Teemo for the bounty on yordles while Twisted Fate refuses because \"messing with Yordles brings a whole heap of trouble.\" Graves then fought Corki , Lulu and Tristana who came to save Teemo, which ended up in Graves being turned into a frog and the Yordles escaping."}

He seeks balance within, so that his mind does not get lost amidst others, but he also seeks balance without—for the Freljord's mystical landscape can only thrive with the growth that comes from conflict and struggle, and Udyr knows that sacrifices must be made to keep peaceful stagnance at bay.\nUdyr was born under a blood-red moon in the Freljord . At a young age, he had a deep connection to spiritual magic, greater than any spirit walker in history. However, his powers proved to be a curse to the young boy. Unlike other spirit walkers, Udyr was connected to every spirit, hearing their every need and want. Bombarded by their chaotic thoughts, Udyr's parents sought to find a spirit walker to help him master his powers, but each one told them: spirit walker training was focused on opening oneself up, not closing oneself off. One evening, his tribe would be attacked by the Frostguard, minions of the Ice Witch . As they slaughtered his tribemen, Udyr became overwhelmed by grief and anger. For the first time, he tapped into his powers with purpose and unleashed an avalanche that buried the marauders. In the aftermath, Udyr would spend the next several years wandering alone, doing what needed to be done to survive.\nOn one fateful day, Udyr aided a Winter's Claw hunting party in battling a troublesome wildclaw. Impressed by his power, they brought him back to their warmother, Hejian, who sought to train him alongside her daughter, Kalkia. The two would grow close, with Udyr showing her how to survive in the wild and Kalkia showing him how to live amongst men. When a pack of diseased rimefang wolves attacked the Winter's Claw, Udyr was affected by their madness, becoming lost to their hunger. He blindly attacked the tribe, nearly killing a child, before being restrained by Kalkia and her mother's True Ice. After the wolves had been slain, Hejian banished him from their tribe. Udyr retreated to the mountains, far from anyone he could hurt, and lived in solitude. Kalkia would occasionally visit the spirit walker, until she had to assume the role of warmother. Despite lifting his banishment, Udyr remained in self-imposed exile, but swore to protect Kalkia and those she loved. However, this would be the last time they would see each other.\nA monk from Ionia arrived in the Freljord and sought out Udyr to help him master the dragon spirit within him. Udyr refused to aid the monk, but he challenged him for the right to train with him. The two battled until they reached their limits, but neither ended as the victor. The monk finally introduced himself as Lee Sin and noted the battle proved they both had much to learn. Lee Sin invited the spirit walker to return with him to train in Ionia, where they have spent generations training to keep the spirits at peace. With nothing him tying him to the Freljord, Udyr agreed.\nSeeing a kindred spirit in the monk, the two would forge a friendship as they traveled to the Hirana Monastery. By the time they reached the Monastery, they found it besieged by Noxian invaders. Udyr and Lee Sin battled the soldiers of Noxus and repelled their assault. After their victory, the two asked the abbott to train them, he agreed, but self-mastery has no guarantee end. The two would spend the next several years at the Hirana Monastery, training with the Shojin Order. During this time, Udyr helped Lee find balance with the dragon spirit and embraced the harmony of the Ionian way of life.\nDespite enjoying the tranquility of Ionia, Udyr's powers began to plateau. Deciding to return to the Freljord to continue his growth, he would say goodbye to his friend, but not before he was gifted with one of Lee's blindfolds, a reminder to their commitment to self-mastery. When Udyr returned, he was greeted by a new conflict between the Avarosans and the Winter's Claw. The Avarosans wanted to unite the Freljord under one banner, but Udyr saw that as detrimental to the land's spiritual health, believing that struggle and conflict were needed to keep the Freljord healthy. Instead, he offered his counsel to his old tribe, the Winter's Claw, and was met by Sejuani , the daughter of Kalkia. Despite accepting his aid, Sejuani was weary of Udyr, having heard the stories of his bloodlust and uncontrollable power. He would earn her trust and mentored the young warmother, watching her become a fierce leader, the two becoming as close as father and daughter.\nUdyr was eventually called to a meeting by the other spirit walkers. During his journey, he encountered the Seal Sister, disguised as an old woman, who asked for his help in several impossible tasks. Entertained by his futile attempts, she gave him her blessing in the form of salty bread and icy water. When he consumed them, spiritual magic surged through Udyr, causing him to pass out. When he awoke, he felt new power coursing through him and continued his journey south. When Udyr reached the meeting of the spirit walkers, they discussed a strange spiritual shift they had all felt. Fearing the Freljord was dying, Udyr believed the cause to be the Avaroans. Their actions in unifying the Freljord had deprived it of the challenge necessary to sustain its spiritual health. While some were skeptical of his theory, others agreed, and pledged their aid to him and the Winter's Claw.\nGrowing food shortages in the already barren tundra would force the Winter's Claw to more aggressively expand their territory. Weakened by the famine and not wanting to see more of her tribesmen fall, Sejuani proposed allying themselves with the Ursine of the Volibear . Udyr was called upon to aid in negotiations, but the spirit walker did not trust the Storm Bear or his ilk. Despite his objections, Sejuani remained determined in forging the alliance, and not wanting to see her harmed, Udyr agreed to aid her.\nThe Winter's Claw summoned the Ursine, led by the Hounded Lord, a former pupil of Udyr. When Sejuani attempted to negotiate with the Hounded Lord, he deferred her to their god, the Volibear, and summoned him to their meeting. Speaking through both Udyr and the Hounded Lord, Volibear questioned what battle would be worthy of his support. Sejuani vowed to raze the southern farms, destroy their settlements, and conquer the Freljord, pleased with these terms the Storm Bear agreed to lend her his strength, if she asked. Udyr tried to object before Sejuani could accept his offer, but was paralyzed by fear. When the Volibear demanded a sacrifice, Udyr instead offered the war and its dead, enraging him. The spirit walker goaded the god into accepting their offer and the Ursine would join the Winter's Claw in their next raid. In the aftermath of the battle, Udyr surveyed the damage inflicted by the Winter's Claw and the Ursine, noting that they were gaining more power. He confronted the avatar of the Volibear and vowed to protect Sejuani and prevent him from taking her.\nSome time later, Udyr would take a leave of absence from the Winter's Claw, needing time away from the spirits to strengthen his will.\nUdyr has a stocky body shape and is adorned by tattoos of the various Freljordian gods on his body. His fists are wrapped in bandages, with his left hand having a headwrap given to him by Lee Sin . He wears heavy pants with a belt made with prayer beads and open toed shoes.\nUdyr is an introspective person, driven by his spiritual powers that grants him a unique understanding of the world. Having grappled with these overwhelming powers since a young age, he embodies a sense of stoic determination and resilience. His demeanor is often calm and reserved, reflecting the solitude he embraced during years of self-imposed exile. Udyr is guided by a sense of duty, particularly towards those he considers family, such as Kalkia and later, Sejuani .\nUdyr serves as the shaman for the Winter's Claw and is Sejuani's oathfather. He was once close to Kalkia , Sejuani's mother.\nUdyr and Lee Sin formed a friendship after the latter traveled to the Freljord to learn more about spirits. He traveled with Lee Sin back to Ionia in order to learn more about spirits and aided in defending the Hirana monastery from Noxian invaders. Lee Sin gave Udyr the blindfold he adorn on his arm, a reminder of his commitment to self-mastery.\nUdyr can harness the power of Freljordian demigods, such as Ornn , Anivia , Volibear , the Seal Sister , and the Iron Boar . Despite harnessing the power of the Great Spirit of the Bear, Udyr does not trust Volibear . He respects his brother Ornn , the Great Spirit of the Ram, far more."}

Bound in iron chains, he was forced to learn the true meaning of strength in the Dredge—a prison mine deep beneath Zaun . Emerging in a disaster that spread chaos throughout the city, he now casts an imposing shadow over its criminal underworld. Raising his victims on the very chains that once enslaved him, he will purge his new home of the unworthy, making it a crucible of pain.\nUrgot was born and raised in Noxus . He became a Noxian soldier and high executioner, or headsman, executing enemies of the state and carrying out missions for the Noxian emperor.\nDuring Swain 's uprising, Swain needed a way to keep Urgot out of the Noxian capitol, as he was seen as a threat to Swain's plan. Urgot was subsequently sent to Zaun under the pretense of being sent there in order to eliminate a conspiracy against the emperor of Noxus. Urgot was then captured by Chem-Barons and taken to The Dredge, a chemtech prison mine, to be tortured. However, Urgot proved to be resistant to pain, which scared the mine's warden and enboldened Urgot. Urgot had an epiphany, believing Zaun to be great because of its pain, and proceeded to take control of the prison and plunge it into anarchy.\nDuring his reign over the prison, Urgot convinced his fellow prisoners into following him while killing those who didn't. He removed some of his body parts that he deemed \"weak\" and replaced them with machinery. Eventually, a Noxian agent arrived in the Dredge. He recognized Urgot and begged him to help him escape, to which Urgot killed him. In doing so, he had another epiphany, believing that it was not strength that ruled Noxus , but men. Believing men to be weak, he decided that he would plunge the world into chaos in order to cull those that he did not find worthy.\nUrgot started a riot which ignited a chemtech vein in the prison, destroying it and shaking Zaun. Many prisoners were killed in the explosion, but many more fleed to the Sump. It was in the Sump where he started gaining more and more followers, preparing to strike again.\nShortly after causing the Dredge to explode, Urgot destroyed the Black Lanes, a market at the heart of Zaun. There, he killed people that worked for a man called Chem-Baron Crimson, along with Crimson himself. While killing Crimson, four adolescents that were part of the Sump Riders gang arrived in the Lanes and saw what was happening. Three of the adolescents died from inhaling toxic fog while Urgot explained to the fourth how all of the men who died, including Chem-Baron Crimson, controlled the city with fear and deserved to die. He let the fourth kid escape, telling him to spread the message about what had happened there.\nA messenger chosen by Urgot, known as The Voice, had been giving speeches and sermons promoting discontent and anger in the Sumps, The Voice preached about a figure he called 'The Dreadnought' and claimed that he would enact justice unto the Piltovans who put the people in the Sumps.

Vi attended one of The Voice's sermons with one of her childhood friends, Roe, and disrupted it, saying that The Voice was just using the people of Zaun to further his own selfish goals. She wasn't able to convince anybody of this, and got ready to leave the Sumps and go back to Piltover, assuming that The Voice and his followers were not much of a danger.\nShortly after this, The Voice, along with his followers, attacked a recently built tower made for Hextech manufacturing. During the attack, Urgot revealed himself to the followers of The Voice. He was revealed to be The Dreadnought that The Voice had spoken about. After deciding that he was not worthy, Urgot killed The Voice. He then released a canister of poisonous gas into the crowd of people that were attacking the tower, calling it a test of strength. Many people died because of this gas, including one of Vi 's childhood friends, Roe. Those who survived continued the attack on the tower, only to be stopped by Vi and Caitlyn along with other Piltovan enforcers.

He was imprisoned at the end of the Great Darkin War , but escaped centuries later in the remade flesh of two Ionian hunters—they had unwittingly released him, cursed to bear the bow containing his bound essence. Varus now seeks out those who trapped him, in order to enact his brutal vengeance, but the mortal souls within still resist him every step of the way.\nVarus was born in the ancient Shuriman empire , where he was a paragon of loyalty and honor. Because of his dedication and skills in archery, Varus was appointed to be a temple warden and sent out to guard the temples of the eastern states. During the early stages of the Icathian Uprising , many of the outlying villages were attacked, including Varus's own homeland. Though the other wardens abandoned their posts to join the defense, Varus upheld his oaths and remained at his post, singlehandedly defending the temple. Knowing that his family had been killed during the attack, Varus was anguished and grieved the loss of his family as he fought off the invaders.\nIn the aftermath, Varus was found by emissaries of the Ascended Host kneeling in deep meditation and surrounded by corpses of his foes. Though successful in defending the temple, the event left Varus horribly traumatized by the event. Despite his unnerving and cold gaze, Varus was offered to join the Ascended as a reward for his noble sacrifice and dedication.\nEven as an Ascended God-Warrior, Varus remained bitter and consumed with a vicious desire for vengeance against the Icathians because of what they did to his homeland and family. He continued to participate in the war and pushed back the rebelling Icathians and the horrors of the Void that they unleashed. During this, he reveled in tormenting his enemies to the point of insanity, torturing them with arrows before painfully killing them. Even after Shurima's eventual victory over Icathia, Varus didn't fully comprehend it as his mind had become so twisted that all of the memories of his atrocities blurred together, leaving him as a withdrawn and heartless killer.\nVarus standing alongside his fellow Darkin, Aatrox and Rhaast .\nAfter the sudden death of emperor Azir , the Shuriman empire fell and the many Ascended, now calling themselves Sunborn , clashed with one another in bitter rivalries due to the lack of leadership. Their war would be so devastating that mortals began to call these beings the Darkin , an ancient Shuriman world most closely translated to The Fallen, and the Great Darkin War began. [ 2 ]\nVarus, who's mind was still twisted beyond repair, couldn't fully comprehend the war happening and instead fully embraced his life as a killer as he was often sent off by his Darkin siblings to assassinate enemy commanders and obliterate entire armies. During the war, Varus fought alongside many of his fellow Darkin, who he considered his brothers and sisters in arms. It's implied that he was a member of a group of five Darkin who were exceptionally powerful and destined to bring ruin to the whole world. These Darkin included Aatrox , Rhaast , Naafiri and an unknown fifth Darkin. At one point, Varus fought alongside his Darkin sister Valeeva, who shared the same desire for violent revenge against those that wronged them. [ 3 ]\nThe Celestial beings of Targon eventually intervened in the war and the 5 Aspect of War began gathering entire armies of mortals to fight back against the Darkin while Myisha, the Aspect of Twilight , taught mortals how to magically imprison them within their own weapons. [ 4 ] After being cornered by a group of vastayan moon-stalkers and human mages serving a golden-armored warrior queen from Valoran , Varus was defeated and bound within his bow. The queen, knowing the risks of handling a Darkin weapon, still chose to wield it during the final days of the war, slowly succumbing to Varus's corruption and turning monstrous. Months later, the warrior queen travelled to the First Lands with Varus in hand and gave a final command to her followers to seal her within a well beneath the mountain temple at Pallas , sacrificing herself and imprisoning Varus within the magical well.\nFor centuries Varus remained hidden within the well, untouched and mostly forgotten. The people of Pallas remained as custodians to the temple, though largely forgetting the ancient history surrounding it but still being wary of the Darkin being imprisoned within.\nIonian hunters Valmar and Kai fighting off invading Noxians.\nAt one point an Ionian hunter named Valmar was born in Pallas and grew up to be a skilled hunter alongside his lover Kai . The two eventually travelled to Pallas to visit Valmar's family and, while at the sacred temple, faced the first wave of Noxian invaders. Valmar and Kai fought back the invaders together to defend their homeland, leading to Kai getting mortally wounded. Now grief-stricken, Valmar began to hear whispers coming out of the forbidden well within the temple. Valmar succumbed to Varus's persuasion and carried Kai into the well with him, believing that the forbidden magic can restore his lover. [ 5 ]\nAs the two swam within the well of Pallas, Varus managed to break down and remake the mortal bodies of Valmar and Kai into a brand new body, repurposing their flesh and souls. Varus emerged out of the well as a unique creature with pale, inhuman beauty; a hybrid of human and Darkin. [ 6 ]\nSoon after Varus climbed out of the well, he realized he could hear the voices of Valmar and Kai within his own mind as separate personalities. The two of them cried out in pain over their new existence, as Varus's imperfect hybrid form allowed the two hunters to remain conscious within his body, becoming a body for not one but three souls. Despite this, Varus reveled in his newfound freedom and immediately began slaughtering the invading Noxians within Pallas. During this, Valmar's hatred for Noxians was emphasized by Varus's cruelty as he supported Varus's slaughter. On the other hand, Kai began to lament his lover succumbing to Varus's influence. When Varus attempted to kill Ionians, Valmar began to struggle for control over Varus's body. Eventually, Kai and Valmar realized that their love for one another was strong enough to overcome Varus's hatred, allowing them to take full control for a time. While Valmar took control of the body, he confronted his mother and bid her farewell, believing that he was too dangerous to keep around the village and decided to travel out of Ionia.\nThe three constantly struggled for control, with Valmar and Kai constantly trying to quell Varus's cruelty. Varus on the other hand went on a vicious pursuit for vengeance against the world, seeking to reunite the rest of his Darkin siblings together and eventually silence the mortal voices within him. [ 7 ]\nVarus's quest to reunite the remaining Darkin eventually brought him back to Shurima, where he was guided by a crook-backed birdlike creature with a withered arm, most likely one of the Baccai . Here he sought out his Darkin sister Naafiri , investigating noises coming from sunken ruins in the distance. Here he sensed the same magic used by the golden-armored queen who imprisoned him and found a group of graverobbers digging out the ruins with beasts of burden.\nVarus quickly killed most of the excavators while the rest of them quickly fled as Valmar and Kai managed to convince Varus to spare them. Once within the ruins, Varus glanced past statues of other Ascended and magically inscribed flagstones in order to find his sister, only to find that the tomb was empty and realizing that Naafiri had already escaped. [ 8 ]\nWhile Varus continued his quest to reunite the Darkin, the three personalities within him learned to coexist as Valmar and Kai came to realize the humanity that remained within Varus. The two slowly prompted Varus to remember the honorable man he once was in the past, urging him to return to that and slowly redeeming his mind from his mad desire for vengeance. Now fully embracing the sum of his parts, Varus began to act as a singular being as his three personalities fought in unison. Though he continues to be bitter against the world that imprisoned him, he now fights with hope that he can return to the honorable man he once was. [ 9 ]\nAfter Xolaani managed to possess a 3 new vessel in Ionia, Aatrox rallied for the rest of the Darkin to join him in Icathia and destroy her. [ 10 ] Varus however didn't answer the call immediately and instead sought to gather a party of skilled warriors to aid him in hunting down Xolaani.\nVarus facing off against Xolaani alongside his hunting party in Icathia .\nBy travelling across the world, Varus met many individuals who he convinced to join him on his hunt, empowering their weapons with a fraction of his own Darkin magic. This party consisted of an 4 ambitious scientist from Zaun who wanted to study the Darkin magic, a 1 sea monster hunter of the Buhru culture wishing to use it to hunt down leviathans, a disgruntled 5 archer of the Avarosans seeking to destroy the Winter's Claw and finally a 2 member of the Lunari cult who sought to end the war between the Lunari and the Solari . The party travelled together to Icathia and finally faced off against Xolaani, though the outcome remains unknown. [ 9 ]\nWhile imprisoned, Varus is trapped as a large, purple, organic bow with sharp spikes that almost resemble tree bark. The bow can produce a deep red and purple glow when firing arrows and can split apart horizontally.\nHis current physical form is a fusion of his Darkin essence mixed with a human body made from the repurposed bodies of Valmar and Kai . Varus stands taller than the average mortal and has pale skin accompanied by dark purple growths across his forearms and the lower half of his body. Varus has pure white hair and eyes with a general face that is inhumanely beautiful to the point where it can be unsettling for mortals to look at him. He wears a red scarf that flows freely across his neck, a crown adorned with a red gem at its center and a leather strap covering the glowing purple wound in his heart, representative of the wound that nearly killed Kai.\nIt is unknown what Varus looked like in his Ascended form but it's possible that his current form somewhat resembles it.\nAs a mortal, Varus was a noble and honorable man willing to remain dedicated to his duties no matter what. Varus's loyalty to his sacred duty ran so deep that he refused to leave his post when the Icathians attacked his homeland and slaughtered his family, leaving him anguished and traumatized by the experience.\nAs an Ascended, Varus grew bitter and even more violently vengeful against others, especially the Icathians that killed his family. Varus enjoyed torturing his enemies to the point of insanity before killing them as a way to sate his desire for vengeance. He had committed so many atrocities that his mind began to break even further as the many atrocities he committed slowly began to blur together, leaving Varus to see himself as nothing but a cold-hearted killer.\nAfter emerging out of the well of Pallas , Varus aimed his vengeance against the mortals that imprisoned him, wishing to destroy the entire world and reunite his Darkin siblings to do so. He completely disregarded mortal life, specifically humans, feeling disgusted by their frailty and bitter against the world that betrayed him.\nValmar and Kai remain within Varus's mind, acting as separate personalities that constantly fight for control. Kai is the more gentler of his personalities, often trying to convince Varus to be merciful and spare mortal lives. Valmar on the other hand is similar to Varus because of his deep hatred against Noxians and desire for vengeance, but still clashes with him over Varus's indiscriminate slaughter. The two use their hope and love for one another as a means of overpowering Varus, gaining control of his body for short periods of time. While Varus initially wished to corrupt or silence their voices, Valmar and Kai have managed to appeal to Varus's humanity, reminding him of the noble man he once was and convincing him to seek redemption. Embracing the sum of his parts, Varus's personalities now act in unison as he now seeks a way to regain his humanity, questioning if he's truly worthy of redemption. Though he's still a merciless killer at times, he has shown to have a renewed sense of honor and has even opened himself up to alliances with other mortals.\nVarus regards most of his fellow Darkin as his brothers and sisters at arms, having fought alongside and against them during the Great Darkin War . During this war, Varus was often sent out by his Darkin siblings to assassinate enemy generals and obliterate entire armies. At some point during the war, it's implied that Varus fought alongside four other Darkin that were notably powerful and destined to one day reunite and bring ruin to the world. These notable Darkin are Aatrox , Rhaast , Naafiri and a currently unknown fifth Darkin.\nAfter emerging from the well of Pallas , Varus focused on enacting brutal vengeance against the world by reuniting the rest of his Darkin siblings, especially the four others destined to unite with him. After his separate personalities appealed to the humanity lost within him, Varus instead focused on fighting for himself and to possibly regain his lost humanity rather than for the Darkin.\nValeeva was one of the Darkin present during the earliest days of the war. She and Varus regard each other as brother and sister, having fought side by side during the war and sharing a brutal desire for vengeance against others. After the Aspect of Twilight killed several Darkin and learned to imprison the rest, Valeeva was one of the survivors but hasn't been seen by Varus since.\nWhen Varus emerged out of Pallas, one of his first missions lead him back to the deserts of Shurima in search of Naafiri, who he deeply regards as his sister. While searching for her in a Shuriman tomb, he comes to realize that it has already been emptied, meaning Naafiri managed to escape before Varus's arrival.\nNaafiri is one of the five Darkin destined to reunite with Varus in bringing the world to ruin. Though it's unclear whether or not the two have reunited since his search for her, Varus deeply respects Naafiri's sense of unity, seeing it as strength and wishing to apply the concept to the rest of his Darkin siblings to work together.\nAatrox is one of the most respected of the Darkin and the first to be imprisoned during the Great Darkin War. It's implied that Varus fought alongside Aatrox at some point during the war, as he is one of the five Darkin destined to reunite and bring ruin to the world. Though the two share a desire the bring oblivion to the world, Varus wishes to do so out of pure revenge, an emotion Aatrox thinks is weak and unbecoming of him as he criticizes the hybrid form he has taken.\nIt's implied there was some 'memo' given to Varus by Aatrox which explained that Varus had to use two A's in his name, officially naming him \"Vaarus.\" However, Varus thought the memo was absurd and refused to comply, angering and offending Aatrox.\n(TBA)\n(TBA)\nAs a mortal, Varus fought against an army of Icathian invaders during the war against Icathia, killing as many as he could to guard his post. The trauma from the incident remained with Varus even after his Ascension, developing a vengeance against the Icathians which caused him to kill their armies without remorse, shaping him into the cold-hearted killer that he would become.\nAfter becoming his vessel, Varus took advantage of Valmar's grief, urging him to embrace vengeance against the Noxians that killed Kai. Thanks to Kai's influence, Valmar was able to resist Varus' temptations and together they tried to dissuade Varus from his path of vengeance, eventually succeeding in breaking through to him.\nWhen he became a vessel for Varus, Kai was initially horrified towards his new existence and wished to have remained dead, but resisted Varus' attempts to corrupt Valmar into falling to vengeance by reminding him of their love. Kai is the more merciful of the two voices and pleads for Varus to spare the lives of his enemies as well as knowing that Varus has the capability for redemption, and together with Valmar he succeeds in helping him realize his humanity."}

He was imprisoned at the end of the Great Darkin War , but escaped centuries later in the remade flesh of two Ionian hunters—they had unwittingly released him, cursed to bear the bow containing his bound essence. Varus now seeks out those who trapped him, in order to enact his brutal vengeance, but the mortal souls within still resist him every step of the way.\nVarus was born in the ancient Shuriman empire , where he was a paragon of loyalty and honor. Because of his dedication and skills in archery, Varus was appointed to be a temple warden and sent out to guard the temples of the eastern states. During the early stages of the Icathian Uprising , many of the outlying villages were attacked, including Varus's own homeland. Though the other wardens abandoned their posts to join the defense, Varus upheld his oaths and remained at his post, singlehandedly defending the temple. Knowing that his family had been killed during the attack, Varus was anguished and grieved the loss of his family as he fought off the invaders.\nIn the aftermath, Varus was found by emissaries of the Ascended Host kneeling in deep meditation and surrounded by corpses of his foes. Though successful in defending the temple, the event left Varus horribly traumatized by the event. Despite his unnerving and cold gaze, Varus was offered to join the Ascended as a reward for his noble sacrifice and dedication.\nEven as an Ascended God-Warrior, Varus remained bitter and consumed with a vicious desire for vengeance against the Icathians because of what they did to his homeland and family. He continued to participate in the war and pushed back the rebelling Icathians and the horrors of the Void that they unleashed. During this, he reveled in tormenting his enemies to the point of insanity, torturing them with arrows before painfully killing them. Even after Shurima's eventual victory over Icathia, Varus didn't fully comprehend it as his mind had become so twisted that all of the memories of his atrocities blurred together, leaving him as a withdrawn and heartless killer.\nVarus standing alongside his fellow Darkin, Aatrox and Rhaast .\nAfter the sudden death of emperor Azir , the Shuriman empire fell and the many Ascended, now calling themselves Sunborn , clashed with one another in bitter rivalries due to the lack of leadership. Their war would be so devastating that mortals began to call these beings the Darkin , an ancient Shuriman world most closely translated to The Fallen, and the Great Darkin War began. [ 2 ]\nVarus, who's mind was still twisted beyond repair, couldn't fully comprehend the war happening and instead fully embraced his life as a killer as he was often sent off by his Darkin siblings to assassinate enemy commanders and obliterate entire armies. During the war, Varus fought alongside many of his fellow Darkin, who he considered his brothers and sisters in arms. It's implied that he was a member of a group of five Darkin who were exceptionally powerful and destined to bring ruin to the whole world. These Darkin included Aatrox , Rhaast , Naafiri and an unknown fifth Darkin. At one point, Varus fought alongside his Darkin sister Valeeva, who shared the same desire for violent revenge against those that wronged them. [ 3 ]\nThe Celestial beings of Targon eventually intervened in the war and the 5 Aspect of War began gathering entire armies of mortals to fight back against the Darkin while Myisha, the Aspect of Twilight , taught mortals how to magically imprison them within their own weapons. [ 4 ] After being cornered by a group of vastayan moon-stalkers and human mages serving a golden-armored warrior queen from Valoran , Varus was defeated and bound within his bow. The queen, knowing the risks of handling a Darkin weapon, still chose to wield it during the final days of the war, slowly succumbing to Varus's corruption and turning monstrous. Months later, the warrior queen travelled to the First Lands with Varus in hand and gave a final command to her followers to seal her within a well beneath the mountain temple at Pallas , sacrificing herself and imprisoning Varus within the magical well.\nFor centuries Varus remained hidden within the well, untouched and mostly forgotten.

Armed with a wrist-mounted crossbow and a heart full of vengeance, she is only truly happy when slaying practitioners or creations of the dark arts, striking from the shadows with a flurry of silver bolts.\nShauna Vayne was born to House Vayne, a wealthy, noble family in Demacia . She experienced a privileged childhood, being able to enjoy solitary pursuits such as reading, learning music, and collecting insects. Shortly after her sixteenth birthday, Vayne would return to home to find her parents dead, killed by a horned demon . The people of Demacia found it inconceivable that a demon would be able to slip past their defenses and murder her parents, but Vayne knew better. Driven by her parent's death, Vayne would seek out a mentor, someone who could teach her how to combat the forces of darkness.\nShe would travel to the Freljord to search for her teacher, learning of the Iceborn warriors who battled the Ice Witch from the stories her parents used to tell her. While traversing the frozen tundra, Vayne would be trapped by a ravenous ice troll. As the troll prepared to consume the young aristocrat, he would fall dead to spear of a grizzled, middle-aged woman. She introduced herself as Frey and bandaged Vayne's wounds. Frey explained that she dedicated her life to fighting the Ice Witch's forces, after they killed her children, and Vayne implored her to take her on as a student. Determining that an aristocrat wouldn't have the resolve to fight against the forces of darkness, she refused, but Vayne would not take no for answer. Vayne challenged the Freljordian to a duel, if she won, Frey would have to train her, but if she lost, she would offer herself as bait for the Ice Queen's minions. Seeing Vayne's determination, Frey would agree to train her and the two would return to Demacia.\nVayne would spend the next several years training and hunting with Frey, growing closer with her mentor and eventually seeing her as a maternal figure. However, she was suspicious as to how her teacher had such an in depth understanding of dark magics. They would frequently travel outside of Demacia to hunt their prey and tales of their valor would spread across Valoran. One day they would catch rumor of the horned demon that had slayed Vayne's parents, she had established a cult designed to do her bidding and lure more victims. As they tracked the demon to her lair, Vayne felt fear that she would lose her mother figure again. Before she could express her concerns, they would be ambushed by one of the cultists, injuring Vayne. In order to protect her, Frey transformed into a Freljordian wolf and tore the priest's throat with a single bite. Frey quickly returned to her human form and tried to explain that she became a shaman to combat the Ice Witch, but Vayne fired a bolt through her heart and any affection she felt died with her.

Vayne swiftly dispatched the shapechanger and avenged the man.\nVayne was present at the Great City of Demacia when Viego unleashed Harrowings across Runeterra.

Vayne took shelter in the Singing Swan Tavern and encountered Gwen , Lucian , Senna , and a Sentinel Rookie seeking more information about the origin of the Harrowing. The Sentinels discovered that the Harrowing was focused around the Mageseeker Compound and Vayne accompanied them to the epicenter of the attack. At the entrance, they would be met by Shyvana , afflicted by the Black Mist, and the half-dragon would attempt to bury them beneath rubble. The group frees themselves and venture further into the compound, Viego secures the artifact guarded by the mageseekers and they give chase to the Ruined King. As they corner him, Shyvana returns and attacks, transforming into a Ruined Dragon at Vayne's provocation. They eventually manage to best Shyvana, but Viego escapes with the artifact. As Vayne prepares to execute Shyvana, Senna convinces her not to, and they agree to lock her up in the mageseeker dungeon. Seeing how ineffective her silver weapons were against the Black Mist, Vayne offers to join the Sentinels, in exchange for Relic weapons.

Along the way, the Sentinels would recruit Malcom Graves , Vayne's no-nonsense attitude would garner Graves' respect and, to Vayne's dismay, friendship. Eventually the Sentinels of Light would prepare their final stand against Viego on the Shadow Isles . Vayne and the other Sentinels battled Karma , Miss Fortune , Pantheon , Shyvana and their army of wraiths, while Akshan , Gwen , Senna and the Rookie would defeat Viego in Camavor.

As a free-spirited inhabitant of Bandle City , he once longed to learn more of the celestial magic practiced by mortals, but his natural curiosity was twisted by imprisonment in the Immortal Bastion. Now a stubborn creature with the dark fury of the stars at his command, Veigar is often underestimated by others—and though he believes himself truly evil, there are some who still question his deeper motivations...\nNot much is known about Veigar's early life in Bandle City . At some point Veigar, dissatisfied with yordle magic, came to the human world wanting to learn about celestial magic. There he learned with human masters how to wield the power of the stars, which he excelled at. This proved to be a mistake, as this caught the attention of the undead warlord Mordekaiser , who was sweeping through Valoran at that time. The tyrant caught Veigar and took him to his domain.\nVeigar was enslaved by Mordekaiser and forced to work for the tyrant. He couldn't escape to Bandle City, as he was bound to the physical plane by Mordekaiser. For years, the yordle was subjected to brutal tortures and abuse until his mind broke. Mordekaiser forced him to twist his magic to hurt others and used him to bring destruction to all who opposed the tyrant. The trauma of those atrocities changed Veigar's personality and appearance.\nYet no one's reign lasts forever, and Mordekaiser was betrayed and overthrown by his servants and the Noxii tribes, led by their god .\nAfter defeating a warlock , Vixis the Cruel, and taking his arcane tower, Veigar tries to scare the local villagers.\nFinally, Veigar escaped from his ensorcelled cage. He was not interested in the struggle for power over the empire; his deepest desire was only peace. But by this point, he could no longer give up evil and embraced it by becoming the evil sorcerer.\nYet unlike his former captor, he wasn't so brutal. Indeed, sometimes he burned pastures or destroyed the mansions of barons. Veigar also drove out brigands and warlords, murdered terrible creatures of darkness, defeated warlocks, and took their magic artifacts. So it was difficult for the good people of Valoran to tell whether these acts were malicious or actually reasonably helpful.\nVeigar embraces his leadership over the minions and his Yordle-followers.\nAt some point in time, Veigar conquered a castle somewhere. Veigar became a dark lord with his own numerous 2 minions and yordle-followers. Among them are: 2 Darkbulb Acolyte and 2 Twisted Catalyzer , who accumulate 3 Darkness and 5 Mana respectively. A 3 Wizened Wizard , who restores runes of long-forgotten folios with the help of shadow magic. 4 Stilted Robemaker , engaged in fashion at court, especially in the matter of increasing height. 4 Tenor of Terror and his brother 4 Bass of Burden , proclaiming the greatness of their master. And a mysterious 8 Mirror Mage , possibly connected with the distant past.\nVeigar and his troops embark on a campaign towards darkness, traveling through Yordle Pathways.\nIn this castle, dangerous artifacts are gradually accumulating, and ancient dark knowledge is being restored. New inventions manifest themselves in the form of war machines combined with artifacts from the dark past. The representation of such a gloomy genius can be the 4 Grand Overseer - a combat mecha equipped with the Rabadon's Deathcap and the Morellonomicon . Step by step, the military power of Veigar and his forces is growing... He also wrote a book ''How to be a Supervillain''.\nVeigar is a small, even for yordle standards, individual. His appearance is obscured under his blue and purple cloak and large hat, which are adorned with many spikes. His most notable accessories are his abnormally large right glove, as well as his axe-like staff (with a gem on its tip).\nUnder his clothing Veigar has black fur and stark yellow eyes, he resembles a black cat. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]\nWhen he first came to Runeterra, Veigar was an enthusiastic and curious Yordle that wished to learn more about magic. This curiosity led him to leave Bandle City , and go to Runeterra in search for knowledge. There he was delighted with the knowledge that he acquired and put all his effort in becoming a powerful mage.\nWhen the warlord Mordekaiser caught him, he was tortured for year under the warlord's brutal watch. This torture broke the Yordle's mind. With his personality broken, he re-imagined himself as a terrible tyrant with a thirst for power.\nUnder this new persona, Veigar is obsessed with the aesthetics of villainy. He's arrogant, melodramatic, and antagonistic, constantly causing chaos in the hopes of getting the attention from others. This often leads to frustration as most of his attempts of villainy either led to mild annoyances, or instead lead to great good. He is also territorial in his search for power, aggressively going after anyone that he considers a rival in his quest for power, which often times, accidentally leads to him coming in direct blows with (and defeating) other dark sorcerers and other evils, accidentally helping many on his path.\nIt's possible that Veigar's acts of good might not be as accidental as it might first appear, but instead his subconscious guiding his actions towards good while his conscious mind, too broken by Mordekaiser's cruelty, rationalizes it to fit in his persona of villain.\nMordekaiser tortured Veigar to gain knowledge about other realms. Eventually, Veigar's personality would shape to be more like his captors. However, due to his yordle nature, he could never perfect his masters cruelty, only a caricature of it.\nVeigar knew LeBlanc, who was also forced to work for Mordekaiser. [ 6 ]\nIn the old lore, Veigar is a friend of Lulu. Their connection in the new lore is left unambiguous."}

As a free-spirited inhabitant of Bandle City , he once longed to learn more of the celestial magic practiced by mortals, but his natural curiosity was twisted by imprisonment in the Immortal Bastion. Now a stubborn creature with the dark fury of the stars at his command, Veigar is often underestimated by others—and though he believes himself truly evil, there are some who still question his deeper motivations...\nNot much is known about Veigar's early life in Bandle City . At some point Veigar, dissatisfied with yordle magic, came to the human world wanting to learn about celestial magic. There he learned with human masters how to wield the power of the stars, which he excelled at. This proved to be a mistake, as this caught the attention of the undead warlord Mordekaiser , who was sweeping through Valoran at that time. The tyrant caught Veigar and took him to his domain.\nVeigar was enslaved by Mordekaiser and forced to work for the tyrant. He couldn't escape to Bandle City, as he was bound to the physical plane by Mordekaiser. For years, the yordle was subjected to brutal tortures and abuse until his mind broke. Mordekaiser forced him to twist his magic to hurt others and used him to bring destruction to all who opposed the tyrant. The trauma of those atrocities changed Veigar's personality and appearance.\nYet no one's reign lasts forever, and Mordekaiser was betrayed and overthrown by his servants and the Noxii tribes, led by their god .\nAfter defeating a warlock , Vixis the Cruel, and taking his arcane tower, Veigar tries to scare the local villagers.\nFinally, Veigar escaped from his ensorcelled cage. He was not interested in the struggle for power over the empire; his deepest desire was only peace. But by this point, he could no longer give up evil and embraced it by becoming the evil sorcerer.\nYet unlike his former captor, he wasn't so brutal. Indeed, sometimes he burned pastures or destroyed the mansions of barons. Veigar also drove out brigands and warlords, murdered terrible creatures of darkness, defeated warlocks, and took their magic artifacts. So it was difficult for the good people of Valoran to tell whether these acts were malicious or actually reasonably helpful.\nVeigar embraces his leadership over the minions and his Yordle-followers.\nAt some point in time, Veigar conquered a castle somewhere. Veigar became a dark lord with his own numerous 2 minions and yordle-followers. Among them are: 2 Darkbulb Acolyte and 2 Twisted Catalyzer , who accumulate 3 Darkness and 5 Mana respectively. A 3 Wizened Wizard , who restores runes of long-forgotten folios with the help of shadow magic. 4 Stilted Robemaker , engaged in fashion at court, especially in the matter of increasing height. 4 Tenor of Terror and his brother 4 Bass of Burden , proclaiming the greatness of their master. And a mysterious 8 Mirror Mage , possibly connected with the distant past.\nVeigar and his troops embark on a campaign towards darkness, traveling through Yordle Pathways.\nIn this castle, dangerous artifacts are gradually accumulating, and ancient dark knowledge is being restored. New inventions manifest themselves in the form of war machines combined with artifacts from the dark past. The representation of such a gloomy genius can be the 4 Grand Overseer - a combat mecha equipped with the Rabadon's Deathcap and the Morellonomicon . Step by step, the military power of Veigar and his forces is growing... He also wrote a book ''How to be a Supervillain''.\nVeigar is a small, even for yordle standards, individual. His appearance is obscured under his blue and purple cloak and large hat, which are adorned with many spikes. His most notable accessories are his abnormally large right glove, as well as his axe-like staff (with a gem on its tip).\nUnder his clothing Veigar has black fur and stark yellow eyes, he resembles a black cat. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]\nWhen he first came to Runeterra, Veigar was an enthusiastic and curious Yordle that wished to learn more about magic. This curiosity led him to leave Bandle City , and go to Runeterra in search for knowledge. There he was delighted with the knowledge that he acquired and put all his effort in becoming a powerful mage.\nWhen the warlord Mordekaiser caught him, he was tortured for year under the warlord's brutal watch. This torture broke the Yordle's mind. With his personality broken, he re-imagined himself as a terrible tyrant with a thirst for power.\nUnder this new persona, Veigar is obsessed with the aesthetics of villainy. He's arrogant, melodramatic, and antagonistic, constantly causing chaos in the hopes of getting the attention from others. This often leads to frustration as most of his attempts of villainy either led to mild annoyances, or instead lead to great good. He is also territorial in his search for power, aggressively going after anyone that he considers a rival in his quest for power, which often times, accidentally leads to him coming in direct blows with (and defeating) other dark sorcerers and other evils, accidentally helping many on his path.\nIt's possible that Veigar's acts of good might not be as accidental as it might first appear, but instead his subconscious guiding his actions towards good while his conscious mind, too broken by Mordekaiser's cruelty, rationalizes it to fit in his persona of villain.\nMordekaiser tortured Veigar to gain knowledge about other realms. Eventually, Veigar's personality would shape to be more like his captors. However, due to his yordle nature, he could never perfect his masters cruelty, only a caricature of it.\nVeigar knew LeBlanc, who was also forced to work for Mordekaiser. [ 6 ]\nIn the old lore, Veigar is a friend of Lulu. Their connection in the new lore is left unambiguous."}

With an endless supply of teen angst and a powerful shadow in tow, Vex lives in her own self-made slice of gloom, far from the revolting cheer of the “normie” world. Though she lacks ambition, she is quick to strike down color and happiness, stopping all would-be interlopers with her magical malaise.\nVex was born and raised in Bandle City , and despite her parents' best efforts, Vex never felt like she belonged. She disliked the city's bright colors and she could never really find her \"yordle spirit\" or any like-minded friends. She spent most of her time sulking in her room, spending time with her shadow, which she liked because it was dark and never said anything.\nEventually, the Black Mist came to Bandle City. While the other residents of the city fought back against the Mist, Vex was intrgued by it and followed it to its source, the Shadow Isles . Vex loved it, as it was dark, gloomy, and full of dead spirits, which she liked. As she stayed there longer, she noticed that a combination of the Black Mist and her passive yordle magic allowed her shadow to gain sentience and also changed her magic, allowing her to cast gloomy and dark spells.\nAfter a time, Vex met Viego , making an alliance with him to plunge the world into darkness and gloom. However, soon Vex found out of Viego's real goal: bringing his dead wife back to life. Disgusted by this show of love, Vex left Viego's side to go back to the Bandle City to tell her parents of all she had done and bask in their disapproval. But when her parents told her that they loved her unconditionally, Vex just sighed, told her parents that they were the worst, and left for the Isles once more.\nVex is a yordle with pale skin, purple eyes, light turqoise hair, and a black nose and mouth. She wears a big purple and black sweater and has a gold emblem of the Shadow Isles on her chest.\nVex is a sad and gloomy yordle that finds contentment in misery. She is eternally unhappy, and is content with this unhappiness. She is easily irritated, especially by bright and happy things, and can easily bring down the mood of any creature with her sadness.\nVex's parents tried to help her find her \"yordle spirit\" when she was younger, though their positivity only made her resent them. After cutting ties with Viego , she went back to her parents to boast about her crimes so they would hate her, but to her disappointment they forgave her and claimed that they loved her no matter what. Despite her hatred towards them, Vex created 2 effigies of her parents to keep herself company while reenacting her childhood and talking to them while pretending that they're her parents, showing she values their presence to a degree.\nMilty is Vex's adoptive uncle. He always tries to understand his niece and influence her positively, but she refuses to deal with him due to his positive attitude.

With an endless supply of teen angst and a powerful shadow in tow, Vex lives in her own self-made slice of gloom, far from the revolting cheer of the “normie” world. Though she lacks ambition, she is quick to strike down color and happiness, stopping all would-be interlopers with her magical malaise.\nVex was born and raised in Bandle City , and despite her parents' best efforts, Vex never felt like she belonged. She disliked the city's bright colors and she could never really find her \"yordle spirit\" or any like-minded friends. She spent most of her time sulking in her room, spending time with her shadow, which she liked because it was dark and never said anything.\nEventually, the Black Mist came to Bandle City. While the other residents of the city fought back against the Mist, Vex was intrgued by it and followed it to its source, the Shadow Isles . Vex loved it, as it was dark, gloomy, and full of dead spirits, which she liked. As she stayed there longer, she noticed that a combination of the Black Mist and her passive yordle magic allowed her shadow to gain sentience and also changed her magic, allowing her to cast gloomy and dark spells.\nAfter a time, Vex met Viego , making an alliance with him to plunge the world into darkness and gloom. However, soon Vex found out of Viego's real goal: bringing his dead wife back to life. Disgusted by this show of love, Vex left Viego's side to go back to the Bandle City to tell her parents of all she had done and bask in their disapproval. But when her parents told her that they loved her unconditionally, Vex just sighed, told her parents that they were the worst, and left for the Isles once more.\nVex is a yordle with pale skin, purple eyes, light turqoise hair, and a black nose and mouth. She wears a big purple and black sweater and has a gold emblem of the Shadow Isles on her chest.\nVex is a sad and gloomy yordle that finds contentment in misery. She is eternally unhappy, and is content with this unhappiness. She is easily irritated, especially by bright and happy things, and can easily bring down the mood of any creature with her sadness.\nVex's parents tried to help her find her \"yordle spirit\" when she was younger, though their positivity only made her resent them. After cutting ties with Viego , she went back to her parents to boast about her crimes so they would hate her, but to her disappointment they forgave her and claimed that they loved her no matter what. Despite her hatred towards them, Vex created 2 effigies of her parents to keep herself company while reenacting her childhood and talking to them while pretending that they're her parents, showing she values their presence to a degree.\nMilty is Vex's adoptive uncle. He always tries to understand his niece and influence her positively, but she refuses to deal with him due to his positive attitude. When he came to find Vex on the Shadow Isles, he tried to forcibly take her back to Bandle City, but she decided to crush his positive worldview with her nihilism so he would leave her alone, causing him to leave while crying in despair.\nVex had an alliance with Viego to plunge the world into darkness and gloom until Vex found out that his real motive was to revive his wife from the dead.\nAllay has a one-sided friendship towards Vex, referring to her as Vee and organizing birthday parties for her, to Vex's annoyance.\nGrimm is in love with Vex and feels infatuated towards her gloomy nature, often making dramatic shows to profess his love towards her. In return, she is shown to genuinely tolerate him despite being disinterested by his displays of love."}

Viego had begun to neglect his kingdom in favor of his queen and his enemies began to conspire against him. They had sent an assassin to kill the wayward king, but they were intercepted by general Kalista. However, Isolde was poisoned in his place. The king ordered the nation's greatest healers and scholars to find a cure for the queen, but when they failed, he sent Kalista to search for one instead. While the king was preoccupied with keeping the queen alive, the kingdom continued to be neglected and uprisings plagued the country. He ordered commander Hecarim and his knights to quash these insurrections and hundreds were put to death. Eventually, the queen would pass and the king sank into a deep depression. Hecarim proposed invading foreign lands as retribution for the queen and Viego approved. As the armies of Camavor prepared to set sail, Kalista had returned with word of a cure.\nKalista had sailed to the Blessed Isles and learned of the Waters of Life, which could cure any disease. But by the time she had returned, the queen was dead. Kalista did not believe the cure was of any use after the queen had passed, but Viego refused to believe her and had her imprisoned for treason. Kalista was eventually convinced to show the king the location of the cure and he and his armies would sail to the Blessed Isles. The residents of the island refused to grant him access to the waters, so Viego ordered Kalista to slay them, but she refused. Hecarim and his knights would be more then happy to follow the king's orders and clashed with Kalista's forces, while Viego searched for the waters himself. The king fought his way to the waters, guided by the conniving warden who become Thresh . When he made it to the vault, Viego lowered Isolde into the waters' healing properties and watched with hope. The queen revived as a former shadow of herself and attacked the king with his own sword. The magic of Viego's blade and the blessed waters mixed, transforming it into the Black Mist and unleashing ruination. The Blessed Isles would transform into the Shadow Isles and Viego slumbered within his blade for centuries.\nViego would eventually be awakened by Gangplank and Thresh , who planned on using him to conquer Bilgewater. Still weak from his slumber, Viego gathered his strength, fueled by his desire to be reunited with his queen. Eventually Gangplank would try to subjugate Viego with a powerful amulet, but would fall to the king's power. He would possess the pirate and used him to hold off Ahri , Braum , Illaoi , Miss Fortune , Pyke , and Yasuo , while he flew to Bilgewater to search for his queen. The champions of Bilgewater would eventually defeat Viego, weakening him with his own memories and imprisoning him within the amulet. The amulet would be guarded by Illaoi.\nIllaoi departs for the Shadow Isles in search of the Brethren of the Dusk, the original creators of the amulet, to find out if she can destroy it, with Viego trapped inside. She is escorted there by Ruven, a captain indebted to Miss Fortune. On Isles, Illaoi meets Yorick, the last member of the brotherhood, who reveals they can destroy the amulet, but requires a heart source hot enough. They decide on a nearby volcano, but as they set sail, Ruven betrays revealing he is the puppet of Bartek, an agent of Thresh. Bartek manages to wrest the amulet from them and retuns it to Thresh.\nAt some point Viego would escape the amulet and resume his search for Isolde. He would be made aware of a fragment of her soul within Senna and intercepted her and her husband Lucian . Viego would unleash Harrowings in Demacia, Ionia, and Noxus while he tried to separate the fragment from Senna. He would manage to pry a portion of the fragment within her before they escaped. Viego soon encountered a gloomy Yordle on the Shadow Isles named Vex . Vex was enamored by Viego's darkness and agreed to help spread the Black Mist across the world. With the help of his new companion, Viego would unleash a global Harrowing to scour the world for the soul fragments.\nHe would obtain the fragments and bend several champions to his will including Draven , Karma , Miss Fortune , Pantheon , and Shyvana . Along the way he and his forces would be confronted by the Sentinels of Light. After obtaining most of the fragments, the Sentinels launched a final assault on Viego on the Shadow Isles. There he would obtain the last three fragments within Senna, Gwen and the Maiden of the Mist. His forces held off the Sentinels while he took the fragments to Camavor to revive his queen. Viego resurrected Isolde, but she was horrified at what he had become. Isolde prompted Akshan to kill her, reviving Senna, Gwen and the Maiden, and the Sentinels would defeat the king, leaving him imprisoned in Hallowed Mist forever.\nAs a wraith, Viego has a pale complexion, spectral green eyes and white hair. He is adorned by a green, spectral crown and a triangle shaped wound in his chest, where Black Mist pours out. Viego wears a black leather jacket and pants with light armorments and no shirt showing off her bare, sculpted chest. He wields Sanctity, the Blade of the King, a spectral Zweihänder with the crest of Camavor on its hilt. Viego can also manifest armor made from Black Mist, including a helmet and a chest plate.\nIn life, Viego's complexion was close to fair, and his skin was slightly tanned. His hair has a brown color. He wore a blue leather jacket and undershirt with black pauldrons and gauntlets with gold accents. He also wore brown pants with black boots. He wielded an uncorrupted version of Sanctity, adorned by gold and jewels.\nViego was an incredibly passionate, yet arrogant man. Due to being raised in nobility, Viego was given everything in life and believed all was his. He was deeply enamored with his wife Isolde, and would dote on her. His devotion to his wife lead him to be highly disinterested in ruling their kingdom and neglect his responsibilities. He has shown himself to be a perfectionist, having high expectations of his queen and would berate her when she couldn't live up to them. When Isolde was poisoned, Viego became obsessed with saving her, using all of the kingdom's resources to try and keep her alive. When the queen had passed, he was willing to slaughter thousands and defy death itself in order to bring her back. Centuries later, his obsession remains, willing to plunge the world into darkness in order to revive his queen.\nKalista is Viego's niece and was his most trusted general in life. Despite being her uncle, Kalista was like an older sister to Viego, the two were friends for a long time since he was largely ignored in favor of Kalista's father. When her grandfather died and Viego became king, his negative traits were worsened and they began to drift apart, however she was still loyal to him.\nKalista managed to protect Viego from an assassin, but resulted in Isolde getting poisoned instead. She would set sail in order to find a cure, but found it too late and was imprisoned as a traitor for her failure. She was eventually convinced by Hecarim to lead Viego and their army to the Blessed Isles for the Waters of Life. When the masters of the island refused to let them use the water, Viego ordered her to kill anyone who opposed them. Kalista refused and was stabbed by Hecarim before her forces clashed with the Iron Order.\nHecarim was the leader of the Iron Order, a brotherhood of knights which vowed to protect the king's lands. Under Viego, Hecarim and the Iron Order acted as the king's enforcers and quelled growing dissent after Viego began neglecting his duties. Hecarim and his knights accompanied Viego to the Blessed Isles. They held off Kalista's forces and pillaged the city while Viego attempted to heal Isolde.\nIn The Despoiler of Havenfall , it is revealed that Hecarim does not think highly of Viego and only continues to follow him because he can spread the Black Mist across Runeterra and allows him to pillage the land.\nAlthough Viego calls Vladimir his uncle in game, they are only distantly related due to both descending from the royalty of Camavor. [ 2 ] At some point after being taken by his Darkin master, Vladimir started sending customary, yearly letters to his original kingdom. After Isolde was poisoned, a grief stricken Viego refused to respond, not knowing Vladimir had the power that could have saved her. [ 3 ]\nViego's wife is a seamstress named Isolde. Viego was selfish, self-centered, young, immature, and had a lot of power. So when he saw someone as beautiful as Isolde, he had to have her. She accepted because she was a commoner from a conquered country. [ 4 ] Viego was a perfectionist in his relationship with Isolde, so when she couldn't live up to his expectations, he would berate her. However, the thought of not being the perfect husband for her disturbed him and he would abandon the memories of the times they fought. [ 5 ] It is uncertain if Viego truly loved Isolde or loved that she was his because he was raised to take anything he desired. Regardless, he doted and focused on her and ignored his duties as king. Viego’s love for Isolde is characterized by utter obsession to the exclusion of everything else, and driven by a lack of understanding of any motivations other than his own. [ 6 ]\nIsolde stabbed Viego with his own blade after he resurrected her. The magic of the waters and the ancient sword caused Ruination which turned the Blessed Isles into the Shadow Isles . When Viego resurrected Isolde a second time, she was disgusted at what he had become and the atrocities he had committed to bring her back. She would allow Akshan to kill her again with his Absolver to revive Gwen and Senna and weaken Viego.\nGwen was created by Isolde and she associates him with the pain of Isolde being taken away from her. She opposes Viego and sided with the Sentinels of Light to stop the pain he has caused in his search for Isolde's soul fragments. Gwen contained a fragment of Isolde's soul.\nThresh led Viego to the Waters of Life where he resurrected Isolde. Thresh and Gangplank woke Viego up from his slumber in order to use him to conquer Bilgewater. Thresh plotted against Viego during Rise of the Sentinels and secretly siphoned the excess Black Mist he was producing in order the unbind himself from the Shadow Isles.\nSenna was cursed to have a fragment of Isolde's soul within her, leading to her being relentlessly hunted by the mist. Later, she learned the truth about the mist during her time inside Thresh's latern. After being freed from it, Senna and her husband Lucian were determined to defeat Viego. Upon finding out about Senna's relation to Isolde, Viego confronted her and Lucian and partially separated Isolde from her body. She, Akshan , Gwen and a Sentinel Rookie would eventually defeat him in Camavor and leave him restrained in Hallowed Mist.\nViego unleashed a global ruination with the aid of Vex during Rise of the Sentinels . Vex was enamored by Viego's desire to plunge the world into darkness and aided him in causing a global ruination, but would later abandon him when she discovered that he was doing it for love\nMaokai and Yorick were hunting for Viego in hope of restoring the Blessed Isles. The Maiden of the Mist was one of the fetters of Isolde's soul.\nDuring the events of Ruined King , Ahri , Braum , Illaoi , Miss Fortune , Pyke and Yasuo set sail to the Shadow Isles to confront Viego in order to protect Bilgewater . Viego tried to tempt Miss Fortune into joining with him, promising her the power to rule Bilgewater and even bring back her mother, but her will proved stronger and she would imprison him in a Buhru artifact. Miss Fortune would eventually join Viego during Rise of the Sentinels, after months of fighting over Bilgewater with Gangplank.\nViego would eventually escape the Buhru artifact and unleash harrowings across multiple regions to begin his search for the fragments of Isolde's soul. These harrowings were repelled by multiple champions including: Darius , Karma , Poppy , Samira , and Vayne .\nHe corrupted multiple champions, such as Draven , Karma , Pantheon , Miss Fortune and Shyvana , to aid in his search. [ 7 ] Multiple champions were recruited by the Sentinels of Light to stop him such as Diana , Graves , Irelia , Olaf , Pyke , Rengar , Riven and Vayne ."}

Viego had begun to neglect his kingdom in favor of his queen and his enemies began to conspire against him. They had sent an assassin to kill the wayward king, but they were intercepted by general Kalista. However, Isolde was poisoned in his place. The king ordered the nation's greatest healers and scholars to find a cure for the queen, but when they failed, he sent Kalista to search for one instead. While the king was preoccupied with keeping the queen alive, the kingdom continued to be neglected and uprisings plagued the country. He ordered commander Hecarim and his knights to quash these insurrections and hundreds were put to death. Eventually, the queen would pass and the king sank into a deep depression.

An idealist who seeks to lift the people of Zaun to a new level of understanding, he believes that only by embracing a glorious evolution of technology can humanity's full potential be realized. With a body augmented by steel and science, Viktor is zealous in his pursuit of this bright future.\nViktor was born in Zaun, on the borders of the Entresol level. Encouraged by his artisan parents, he discovered a passion for invention and building from a young age. He devoted his whole being to his studies, hating to interrupt his work even to eat or sleep. Abandoning his work, under any circumstances, was nearly impossible for him.\nViktor had conducted research on Zaun’s many accidents and came to the discovery that most of them were the result of human error, as opposed to being a result of mechanical failure. He offered his services to local businesses, developing inventions in the hopes of creating safer work environments. Most refused to work with him, but the Fredersen Chem-forge gave the young man a chance.\nHis inventions reduced the number of accidents in the forge to null within a month, and so other establishments began to seek out his work. His designs became common in Zaun, improving production with every innovation.\nSoon enough, at the age of nineteen he was offered a place in Zaun’s prestigious Academy of Techmaturgy. Viktor’s work had attracted the eye of Professor Stanwick of Piltover , who convinced him to go to Piltover’s academy instead. There, he could work in the most advanced laboratories and have access to all the resources the City of Progress could offer him. Viktor accepted his offer, taking residence in Piltover, where he refined his craft and strived to perfect his theorems in ways that would benefit everyone.\nIn Piltover, Viktor worked frequently with the best and brightest the city had to offer, which included the insufferable Jayce . They worked together frequently, though in Viktor's words, he and the flamboyant and arrogant genius were intellectual equals, but clashed in personality. They would often argue over their perceptions of intuition vs. logic in the process of invention, never becoming friends but each able to mutually respect and recognise the flawed brilliance of the other.\nIn the middle of his studies, a major chem-spill devastated entire districts of Zaun, and Viktor returned home to help. These efforts included building an unintentionally sentient golem, whom Viktor named Blitzcrank , and together they saved many from the disaster. The two parted ways after failing to prevent more deaths resulting from the radioactive aftermath, and Viktor returned to Piltover. Though distraught at the loss of life, this experience enlightened Viktor to what could be done when fusing technology and human anatomy for the enhancement of the latter.\nHowever, during Viktor's absence, Professor Stanwick had claimed Blitzcrank as his own invention. Viktor's pleas did nothing for him with the indifferent higher-ups. Pursuing the matter, he asked Jayce to help verify his case, but his schoolmate refused. With the odds stacked against him, Viktor was unable to bring the truth to light. Bitter but resigned, Viktor returned to his work, knowing that bettering lives and creating change was more important than credit and ego.\nThis matter, however, only served to push him to obsess over eradicating human error from innovation. His growing interest in improving human performance with technology and eliminating the \"grossly inefficient abberation\" of human involvement created tension between him and his fellow students and professors who saw the very things Viktor sought to remove as the source of human ingenuity and creativity.\nThis came to fruition during a collaboration with Jayce to improve diving suits used to keep Piltover’s docks clear of underwater debris and lingering chemical waste.\nAs a solution to the fear-resultant hallucinations experienced by the divers underwater, which were leading many to fatal watery ends, Viktor devised a helmet that would allow an operator on the surface to bypass the wearer's fear-response and effectively control the diver. A heated discussion between Viktor and Jayce on free will and mental enslavement turned bitter and the two vowed never to work together again. Jayce later reported the incident to the college masters, who then expelled Viktor for work that violated basic human dignity—work that, in Viktor's eyes, would have saved lives.\nDisgusted by the narrow-minded attitudes he encountered in Piltover, Viktor retreated to his old laboratory in Zaun. The combination of his failure to save lives in Zaun, failure to prove his creation of Blitzcrank, and expulsion from Piltover caused him to sink into a deep depression. Despite his professed revulsion for the human aspect negative impacting innovation, he had let his own emotions get the better of  his efforts to help others and save lives. His naive belief that good intentions could overcome ingrained prejudice had blinded him to human failings.\nTo solve this, he operated on himself to remove those parts of his flesh and psyche that relied upon or were inhibited by emotion.\nWhen the surgery was done, almost no trace of the young man who had traveled to Piltover remained. In supplanting the majority of his anatomy with mechanical improvements, his personality had also been modified. His idealistic hope to better society was refined into an obsession with what he called the Glorious Evolution. Viktor now saw himself as the pioneer of Valoran's future - an idealized dream where man would renounce flesh in favor of superior hextech augmentations. This would free humanity from fatal errors and suffering, though Viktor knew it was a task that would not be completed easily or quickly.\nAnother one of Zaun's common chemical disasters in the Sump turned hundreds in the Factorywood into rabid psychotics. Viktor brought the victims back to his lab, where he tried to undo the damage and slow the degenerative processes. However, what he had in his lab would not be enough to save these people. What he needed was more power - which he detected a surge of in Piltover, in Jayce's lab. The source was a Shuriman crystal, and it would solve everything.\nHe demanded that Jayce hand the crystal over, but the Piltovan refused, and so Viktor had to take it by force. Returning to his lab, he set to work, readying a new automaton body for the victims in case the damage on their bodies proved to be too much. However, in the middle of his attempt, Jayce burst in with an energized hammer and began destroying what he had worked for. Knowing Jayce would never listen to reason, he ordered the automatons to kill him. At the end of the fight, Jayce brought his hammer down on the crystal, causing the entire warehouse to collapse, taking the lives Viktor had been trying to save.\nViktor escaped the explosion, and returned to his mission of bettering humanity by ridding it of its destructive emotional impulses. In Viktor’s mind, Jayce’s impetuous attack only proved the truth of his cause and strengthened his desire to unburden humanity of the failings of flesh. He sent chem-augmented thugs to Jayce's lab afterwards, not for revenge, but to search for more of the crystal. The raid was unsuccessful , however, and Viktor thought no more of Jayce.  Currently, he is still dedicatedly working on bringing the Glorious Evolution to the people, and saving them from themselves.\nViktor's left arm is a 4-fingered mechanical prosthesis; his other limbs may be prosthetic as well or simply armored. He has a shoulder pauldron on his left, and a deep blue cloak that is red on the inside covering the other shoulder. His right hand wears a gauntlet, and around his waist is a turquoise covering. On his left leg he wears a brace for support. A third arm extends from his back, fitted with a high-precision high-power laser.\nViktor had an obsessive, idealistic personality, and was a workaholic. He was a self-described methodical, logical and thorough person, and is implied to previously have been emotional. He was interested in how techmaturgy could help society.\nFollowing his efforts to improve himself, his obsessive tendencies heightened, and reportedly is now less capable of emotion than before. His previous interest developed into a mission he has devoted his life to.\nViktor has shown little regard for free will and autonomy when dealing in matters of life and death. He believes he is doing what is right and is generally benevolent, but uses ethically dubious methods to achieve desired results.\nNote: The following description will prioritise the facts as listed in Viktor's biography as opposed to Blitzcrank's , given that this is Viktor's wikipage. The only notable conflicts would be in Blitzcrank's origins and the reasons for their separation. Where Blitzcrank's biography states he was an abandoned golem given sentience through the means of a hextech crystal, Viktor's biography describes events differently. Blitzcrank also credits the parting of their ways to a chem-baron. In terms of matters omitted, Blitzcrank does not seem to be involved in the events in Piltover between Professor Stanwick and Viktor.\nBlitzcrank was a custom-built golem, constructed by Viktor in order to help in the clean-up efforts following a devastating chem-spill in Zaun. He grafted a sophisticated series of cognitive loops onto existing automata-technology, which formed the basis of Blitzcrank's intelligence and later unintended sentience. The two worked together to better the lives of those affected by the spill. Unfortunately, their efforts failed to prevent more deaths, and so the two parted ways.\nLater in Piltover, Professor Stanwick claimed Blitzcrank as his own invention. Viktor challenged him, but backed by no one, he lost the case.\nThe two currently have no reason to be unfriendly with each other.\nJayce and Viktor are ex-colleagues and current enemies. They disagree over many topics relating to ethics in science, most pertaining to free will."}

In addition to unnaturally extending his life, his mastery of hemomancy allows him to control the minds and bodies of others as easily as his own. In the flamboyant salons of the Noxian aristocracy, this has enabled him to build a fanatical cult of personality around himself—while in the lowest back alleys, it allows him to bleed his enemies dry.\nVladimir was once a prince of Camavor , but was given away as a royal hostage to an unknown Darkin as a bargain to save the kingdom from the monster's tyranny. Should the king break faith with the Darkin, the prince would be slain.\nVladimir was taken to Shurima in which his Darkin master dwelled. He was given permission to write and sent customary letters to his kingdom, but his letters were all ignored.  He eventually learned that his father had broken his oath within the year. Because his father had sons and heirs aplenty, the death of Vladimir would mean nothing to the king.\nSurprisingly, instead of getting killed as he expected, his Darkin master had something altogether more amusing in mind. The Darkin offered Vladimir the chance to lead his armies against his father's kingdom, an offer he gladly accepted. He destroyed his father's kingdom and presented his father's head to his master as a way to prove his loyalty. Believing himself above other mortal vassals, his devotion earned him a place of favor in his patron's warhost, and he learned hemomancy. Darkin teaching their secrets to mortals was forbidden under pain of death, but his master delighted in flaunting the mores of his kind. Over time, the god-warrior watched with amusement as Vladimir came to govern his subjects with as little mercy as the Darkin themselves. His Darkin master would later teach other mortals blood magic, but none were as capable and talented as Vladimir.\nEventually, near the end of the Great Darkin War , the enemies of the Darkin united. The Darkin master instructed Vladimir to lead his armies in defense against his unified enemies. Unknown to all but Vladimir himself, he had already found a method to kill a god-warrior. Vladimir killed his master instead and absorbed his power. Scarred, blinded, driven mad by the radiance of a Darkin’s undoing, he absorbed enough power to renew flesh that was never meant to last beyond a mortal lifespan. A few surviving mortals fled, taking what knowledge they had of blood magic with them.\nSome time after the war ended, Vladimir moved to the Blessed Isles , expanding his knowledge of magic and collecting various magical artifacts.\nAt the height of the Reign Of The Iron Revenant , it was said that a mythic and bloodthirsty fiend haunted the coastal cliffs of eastern Valoran, demanding young lives and savage worship from the local barbaric Noxii tribes. Few were welcome in his lair, until the day a pale sorceress approached the barbarian god with an offer. The two feasted together as equals, weaving magic so dark that the wine at their table soured, and the roses withered, vibrant red turning to black. This encounter would result in the formation of the Black Rose , and so began the pact between Vladimir and LeBlanc. Vladimir then rallied all the Noxii tribes and lead the siege in which The Iron Revenant was ultimately defeated. This alliance neutralized the source of his power, The Immortal Bastion . They managed to sever the anchors of his soul from his armor, as well as seal the empty iron shell away in a secret place. Thus Mordekaiser's reign was ended, and he was cast out of the material realm.\nFrom a visit by General Kalista to the Blessed Isles, Vladimir received the news of the current king of Camavor and the loss of his wife . He attempted to contact the king and wrote a letter to him, but the grief-stricken Viego refused to respond, not knowing Vladimir had the power and knowledge that could have saved her. When Viego sailed for the Blessed Isles with his armies, Vladimir foresaw disaster approaching and left the region soon after, narrowly avoiding The Ruination of Helia .\nAfter Helia fell to the Ruination, the remnants of an ancient order from the Blessed Isles, whose mission had been to gather and protect the most dangerous artifacts in Runeterra , struggled to keep knowledge of the World Runes hidden. Political tension followed as nations were unwilling to trust one another for fear of being unwittingly destroyed by these runes. The leaders of two rival Noxii tribes pleaded with Tyrus of Helia, in parley at the village of Khom . The encounter ended in the complete destruction of Khom and its surrounding territories by the power of two World Runes. During The Rune Wars , magical fallout resulting from the almost apocalyptic battle forced Vladimir and the last of the Noxii to retreat into The Immortal Bastion for shelter. When they finally emerged, the land beyond had been ravaged, but they survived. From that day onward, they were united as a single people, no longer as Noxii but Noxus . The capital, Noxus Prime , was built center at the still unbreachable Immortal Bastion. This event marks The Resurgence of Civilizations and the beginning of the Noxian Calendar, and they have marked their calendar from this date ever since.\nOver the centuries, others joined them—powerful nobles, exalted masters of magic, and beings darker still. Rife with disputes, and games of politics and war, Black Rose grew into the hidden power that would guide the throne of Noxus for more than a thousand years, orchestrating many of the empire’s most ambitious campaigns. Noxus began to forcefully annex numerous territories alongside its eastern borders. After a series of forced annexations and the fall of The Drakkengate , the strength of Noxus grew to match its ambitions.\nDuring the Battle of the Greenfangs , a skilled order of Noxian warmages known as the Arcane Fist, led by Vladimir, bombarded the Demacian troops for thirteen days. Afterwards the colossus with wings mirroring the image of the Winged Sisters known as Galio awakened for the first time. Galio would later protect the Demacian soldiers during their hold against the invading warmages and single-handedly defeated the entire mage army. After all the invading mages were defeated and withdrew, Galio returned to his pedestal and ceased to move. This bizarre tale was told in hushed tones by the few who had survived the battle, and was usually received with silent incredulity. As the years would go by, the story of Galio and Battle of the Greenfangs would eventually be seen as nothing more than a mere legend. At some point afterward, Vladimir resorted to seclusion, and he was absent in The First Demacian-Noxian War . Over the next half a century, Demacia would end up freeing the countries of Central Valoran from Noxian dominance, pushing the Noxians back towards their capital.\nThe ruling Grand General of the empire, Boram Darkwill , was willing to pay almost any price to restore Noxus' lost glory, and he made an alliance with The Black Rose. With help from Vladimir, LeBlanc spearheaded the resurrection ritual to reanimate the long-dead hero Sion , and presented him to the Grand General. Sion, driven mad by unnatural bloodlust and utterly inured to pain, hurled himself like a living battering ram against allies and foes alike, destroying all he faced. The victories Sion brought were costly. After several battles, Sion's bloodlust was deemed uncontrollable and Boram Darkwill ordered his imprisonment.\nWith the unexpected death of Boram Darkwill and the rise of Jericho Swain as the new Grand General, the political landscape of the empire changed dramatically, and Vladimir has been forced to rouse himself once more. Wearing the guise of a benevolent socialite, he has returned to the public eye as a vocal opponent to the ruling Trifarix council, much to the concern of more cautious members of the Black Rose. His reappearance may have come too soon, as time has not yet washed away all the stains of his previous lifetime, and it seems likely that Swain himself has begun to grasp Vladimir’s true nature.\nVladimir has been passive for too long, but now he is ready to take what is his, that which was for so long denied him—a kingdom of his own. Under Vladimir’s tutelage, the art of hemomancy has found a place in the military of Noxus, and among scions of the old aristocracy. Among these diverse practitioners is the Crimson Circle , a youthful cult dedicated to Vladimir as much as to blood magic itself.\nVladimir is a tall man with an eternally youthful face. He has medium-length white hair and blue eyes that will glow red when he utilizes his magic. He generally wears lavish, aristocratic clothing, always red with a silver or gold trim. His signature outfit consists of knee-high boots, vertically striped pants, and a slim overcoat with a massive, regal collar and metal spikes dangling from the sleeves. Notably, he wears long metal claws on each finger.\nVladimir is an ambitious being that desires to fulfill his immortal life with the pleasures of the world. His flamboyant behavior hides his cruelty and sadism, which he indulges when using his powers on others.\nVladimir made himself a home in Mortoraa, a big castle in a small district within the Immortal Bastion, known for being one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Noxus Prime. Unlike many other districts which are typically cramped, the streets in Mortoraa are luxurious and comfortably spacious. However, at night it has a reputation as the most ominous district, for the streets are never illuminated with torchlight or lanterns.\nUniquely among members of the Black Rose, Vladimir has rarely limited himself to scheming from the shadows. He is very sociable. He prefers to hanging around between the public eye and the secret societies that he built. In the past, he deigned to join the Noxian noble courts during the most interesting of times, only to fade into seclusion decades later. History has lost track of Vladimir on many occasions, though its pages are littered with figures suspected to have been him.\nHe is aware that his memory would not be able to keep up with his extremely old age. Most of his unnaturally extended life endures not in his memory, but in his chronicles. There were a select few memories that Vladimir refused to forget, and so he labored to do what his mind could not. He wrote books about himself. To remember them, he draws and paints portraits that tell the story that is mostly the turning point of events in the world. Portraits of himself were hung about the circular walls of his castle. His portraits show him at a very different times in his life, and all portraits have different framing or style. Those brief moments their lives touched, what felt like an eternity ago. More melancholy, but fitting perhaps. To Vladimir, there was nothing in the world as beautiful as sadness.\nLeBlanc was forced to serve Mordekaiser , whose downfall she would later plan. To do so, she approached Vladimir and the two formed a pact and founded the Black Rose . Vladimir rallied all the Noxii barbarian tribes to siege Mordekaiser's domain while LeBlanc severed the ties of Mordekaiser's magic to The Immortal Bastion , allowing them to be able to defeat The Iron Revenant and end his reign.\nLeBlanc considered Vladimir her only equal because she has never met any mage that can she considered to be as powerful as her. LeBlanc is also quite aware of the Darkin power that Vladimir absorbed, and she had hoped she could outlive Vladimir and take his power for her own. She has been waiting centuries for him to grow old and die, and may not yet realize that Vladimir is capable of revitalizing himself to stay young and powerful.\nVladimir is one of the founders of the organization alongside LeBlanc. He aided the Black Rose for centuries, such as conducting Sion's resurrection, creating Briar , and leading a war against Demacia in the past. Vladimir, however, is not interested in the political machinations of the Black Rose, only assisting them when needed. Unlike all other members of the Black Rose, he often stood out among others and preferred to show up in public from time to time.\nOver time, their growing differences in ideology led Vladimir to create his own cult - the Crimson Circle , and under his tutelage it found a place publicly in the military of Noxus. The quick growth of the Crimson Circle eventually brought LeBlanc into frequent conflict with Vladimir and his inner circle. Vladimir had already alerted his Crimson Circle members through his letters in which the first line says \"Beware the rose \", which also corresponds to Vladimir's ambition to cut ties of his connection to the Black Rose.\nVladimir has recently brought himself back into the public eye, becoming a vocal opponent against the Trifarix Council, and this has caught Swain's attention. However, Vladimir's previous public identity has not been completely forgotten, and it is hinted that Swain may know of Vladimir's true nature.\nOne day , a troop of Trifarix soldiers attempted to intercept the old aging Vladimir on his way home, and they all ended up killed and absorbed by Vladimir as a part of his plan to revitalize himself. The incident was witnessed by one of Swain's ravens, in noticing which Vladimir became aware that Swain was watching him.\nVladimir fought Galio in the Battle of the Greenfangs against Demacia . So far, Galio is also the only opponent that Vladimir has lost to in battle due to Galio being made from Petricite , a material that can absorb magic.\nThe nightblooms grown in Vladimir's mansion were taken from a grove once tended by Maokai . Vladimir also dwelled in the Blessed Isles after The Great Darkin War until fleeing shortly before The Ruination of Helia .\nAlthough Viego calls Vladimir his uncle in game, the age gap between them is more than 1500 years and thus they are only distantly related, both descending from the royalty of Camavor . [ 2 ] After Isolde was poisoned, the grief-stricken Viego refused to respond to Vladimir's letter, not knowing Vladimir had the power that could have saved her. [ 3 ]\nIn The Daring Darling , Vladimir was soul-marked by Kalista , but he was able to banish her with the help of a magical artifact. Kalista is related to Vladimir as well since she is Viego's niece.\nBriar was created with hemomancy, a magical art strongly tied to Vladimir, a founding member of the Black Rose. Though his exact relationship with Briar is unclear, it's heavily implied that he was mainly responsible for her creation. As her creator, Briar somewhat considers Vladimir her 'dad'. though she questions whether or not to actually call him that.\nThe annotated sketch used for Briar's splash art states that she is at Vladimir's castle, acting as a guard dog. [ 4 ] Whether this is true for is unclear, however it does imply a possible relationship between the two after Briar's escape."}

Unlike all other members of the Black Rose, he often stood out among others and preferred to show up in public from time to time.\nOver time, their growing differences in ideology led Vladimir to create his own cult - the Crimson Circle , and under his tutelage it found a place publicly in the military of Noxus. The quick growth of the Crimson Circle eventually brought LeBlanc into frequent conflict with Vladimir and his inner circle. Vladimir had already alerted his Crimson Circle members through his letters in which the first line says \"Beware the rose \", which also corresponds to Vladimir's ambition to cut ties of his connection to the Black Rose.\nVladimir has recently brought himself back into the public eye, becoming a vocal opponent against the Trifarix Council, and this has caught Swain's attention. However, Vladimir's previous public identity has not been completely forgotten, and it is hinted that Swain may know of Vladimir's true nature.\nOne day , a troop of Trifarix soldiers attempted to intercept the old aging Vladimir on his way home, and they all ended up killed and absorbed by Vladimir as a part of his plan to revitalize himself. The incident was witnessed by one of Swain's ravens, in noticing which Vladimir became aware that Swain was watching him.\nVladimir fought Galio in the Battle of the Greenfangs against Demacia . So far, Galio is also the only opponent that Vladimir has lost to in battle due to Galio being made from Petricite , a material that can absorb magic.\nThe nightblooms grown in Vladimir's mansion were taken from a grove once tended by Maokai . Vladimir also dwelled in the Blessed Isles after The Great Darkin War until fleeing shortly before The Ruination of Helia .\nAlthough Viego calls Vladimir his uncle in game, the age gap between them is more than 1500 years and thus they are only distantly related, both descending from the royalty of Camavor . [ 2 ] After Isolde was poisoned, the grief-stricken Viego refused to respond to Vladimir's letter, not knowing Vladimir had the power that could have saved her. [ 3 ]\nIn The Daring Darling , Vladimir was soul-marked by Kalista , but he was able to banish her with the help of a magical artifact. Kalista is related to Vladimir as well since she is Viego's niece.\nBriar was created with hemomancy, a magical art strongly tied to Vladimir, a founding member of the Black Rose. Though his exact relationship with Briar is unclear, it's heavily implied that he was mainly responsible for her creation. As her creator, Briar somewhat considers Vladimir her 'dad'. though she questions whether or not to actually call him that.\nThe annotated sketch used for Briar's splash art states that she is at Vladimir's castle, acting as a guard dog. [ 4 ] Whether this is true for is unclear, however it does imply a possible relationship between the two after Briar's escape."}

Transformed by agonizing experiments, his body is fused with an intricate system of chambers and pumps, machinery filling his veins with alchemical rage. Bursting out of the shadows, he preys upon those criminals who terrorize the city's depths. Warwick is drawn to blood, and driven mad by its scent . None who spill it can escape him.\nDuring his past life as a human, Warwick was a Zaunite gangster named Vander who decided to retire from crime (but not revolutionary ideals) and live a better life as a good and honest bartender. Vander adopted both Vi and Jinx as his daughters. A prodigious boxer and a good-hearted man, he was widely respected by the denizens of the undercity and was willing to die for his own ideals, especially if it meant saving those that he cared about. He was eventually captured, experimented and later resurrected on by the mad scientist Singed , who pumped him full of chemicals containing spliced monster DNA in an attempt to transform him into the \"beast\" he was deep down inside. Although Singed's experiments initially killed Warwick, they later resurrected him as a a biomechanical, werewolf-like beast with an insatiable thirst for blood.\n(TBA)\nWarwick is a large werewolf-like creature, having a mix of human and canine anatomy. He is covered in bluish-gray fur, though his lower face and the front of his torso are paler. He has a canine muzzle full of massive fangs. His eyes are yellow-green by default but can turn a ferocious red in heated moments. His long, pointed ears have pink skin on the inside. He has a hulking, muscular upper body with slimmer legs and a fluffy tail. As a werewolf, he can move on two legs or get down on all fours. He also has numerous scars all over his body due to lacerations.\nWarwick's body is augmented by asymmetrical chemtech machinery composed of brass-colored metal connected by tubes that house glowing green liquid. When Warwick is stressed, this liquid may turn yellow. Most notably, he has a clawed gauntlet on his right forearm and a large cylindrical chamber protruding from his back. This chamber features a single spike, almost giving it the appearance of a syringe. He also wears a pair of brown patchwork pants that are torn and faded.\nWhile not much is known about Warwick's past life, it can be assumed that despite his role as a gangster, Warwick still cared about the well-being of others and sought different ways to better himself, with Singed even describing him as a \"good man\". However, after Singed's experiments on him, little remained of the old Warwick or his memories, as he was replaced with a bloodthirsty, monstrous creature of pure wrath.\nWarwick is a creature in constant pain and wants desperately to remember his past life, but his chemical mutations prevent him from seeking this out. He is proud of his Zaunite origins and holds a special hatred for the chem-barons and the Zaunites who have abandoned the undercity for Piltover . Warwick also sees Yordles as \"alpha predators\", growing distracted by them like a dog would be by a squirrel.\nEven though Warwick has lost most of his memories, he sometimes gets flashes of his former life as a human. These last remaining memories prevent him from harming innocent people and cause him to only attack criminals, specifically those who have blood on their hands."}

Transformed by agonizing experiments, his body is fused with an intricate system of chambers and pumps, machinery filling his veins with alchemical rage. Bursting out of the shadows, he preys upon those criminals who terrorize the city's depths. Warwick is drawn to blood, and driven mad by its scent . None who spill it can escape him.\nDuring his past life as a human, Warwick was a Zaunite gangster named Vander who decided to retire from crime (but not revolutionary ideals) and live a better life as a good and honest bartender. Vander adopted both Vi and Jinx as his daughters. A prodigious boxer and a good-hearted man, he was widely respected by the denizens of the undercity and was willing to die for his own ideals, especially if it meant saving those that he cared about. He was eventually captured, experimented and later resurrected on by the mad scientist Singed , who pumped him full of chemicals containing spliced monster DNA in an attempt to transform him into the \"beast\" he was deep down inside. Although Singed's experiments initially killed Warwick, they later resurrected him as a a biomechanical, werewolf-like beast with an insatiable thirst for blood.\n(TBA)\nWarwick is a large werewolf-like creature, having a mix of human and canine anatomy. He is covered in bluish-gray fur, though his lower face and the front of his torso are paler. He has a canine muzzle full of massive fangs. His eyes are yellow-green by default but can turn a ferocious red in heated moments. His long, pointed ears have pink skin on the inside. He has a hulking, muscular upper body with slimmer legs and a fluffy tail. As a werewolf, he can move on two legs or get down on all fours. He also has numerous scars all over his body due to lacerations.\nWarwick's body is augmented by asymmetrical chemtech machinery composed of brass-colored metal connected by tubes that house glowing green liquid. When Warwick is stressed, this liquid may turn yellow. Most notably, he has a clawed gauntlet on his right forearm and a large cylindrical chamber protruding from his back. This chamber features a single spike, almost giving it the appearance of a syringe. He also wears a pair of brown patchwork pants that are torn and faded.\nWhile not much is known about Warwick's past life, it can be assumed that despite his role as a gangster, Warwick still cared about the well-being of others and sought different ways to better himself, with Singed even describing him as a \"good man\". However, after Singed's experiments on him, little remained of the old Warwick or his memories, as he was replaced with a bloodthirsty, monstrous creature of pure wrath.\nWarwick is a creature in constant pain and wants desperately to remember his past life, but his chemical mutations prevent him from seeking this out. He is proud of his Zaunite origins and holds a special hatred for the chem-barons and the Zaunites who have abandoned the undercity for Piltover . Warwick also sees Yordles as \"alpha predators\", growing distracted by them like a dog would be by a squirrel.\nEven though Warwick has lost most of his memories, he sometimes gets flashes of his former life as a human. These last remaining memories prevent him from harming innocent people and cause him to only attack criminals, specifically those who have blood on their hands."}

After finding a lifelong friend in the warrior known as Master Yi , Wukong became the last student of the ancient martial art known as Wuju. Armed with an enchanted staff, Wukong seeks to prevent Ionia from falling to ruin.\nKong is a member of the Shimon , a monkey-like species of Vastaya who sought wisdom throughout their lives and turn into stone-like forms upon death to begin the cycle anew. Kong used to play pranks on the other Shimon to their annoyance, and once told them that an elemental dragon was going to burn down their home. While they all fled in fear, Kong was laughing. This caused the other Shimon to run out of patience with him and kick him out of the tribe, so Kong decided to find people who would appreciate his sense of humor. He proclaimed himself \"The Monkey King\" and challenged humans to duels or games of cunning. One time, he encountered a group of Noxians whom chased him into the forest, and he didn't reveal himself until he was sure that they had left.\nKong wished to meet the combat masters of Wuju , but to his shock the Wuju village had already been destroyed by the Noxian forces, and there was only a single man who meditated in the ruins. Kong decided to challenge him to a fight, but the warrior beat him instantly. For weeks, Wukong kept challenging him, only to be outsmarted and beaten no matter which angle he came from or which strategies he used, even trying to distract him with hilarious jokes or tampering with his tea.\nKong knelt to the warrior and asked to learn his ways. He accepted and introduced himself as Master Yi , the last master of Wuju, and promised to help turn the Shimon's recklessness into a skilled fighting style. As the two trained together, Yi refused to talk about his past nor why he refused to leave the village. Kong decided to challenge Yi to a duel, making a deal where if Kong won then Yi would tell him his secrets, but if Yi won then Kong would not speak for a year. Yi eagerly accepted the challenge. When the day came, Kong lured Yi into a field of smokepoppies. As Yi was about to make his move on Kong, he instead hit a straw decoy while the real Kong struck him by surprise and grappled him to the ground.\nAfterwards, Yi told Kong the truth: he and his disciples had left to defend Ionia from the Noxian troops, but the village was destroyed and most of the villagers had been killed by the attack, leaving Yi as a sole survivor and one of the only Wuju practitioners currently left in existence. Kong realized that he had wanted to protect the Shimon the same way, despite them casting him out. Proud of his student and finding a new sense of purpose thanks to him, Master Yi gave Wukong a special staff reserved for the best students of Wuju. From then, Kong was given the name Wukong.\nEven after the war had long passed, the Noxians were still encroaching Ionia and oppressing the natives. Wukong and Master Yi made it their mission to combat injustice and hatred wherever they found it.\n(TBA)\nEven back when he was known as Kong, Wukong was always proud of his own fighting skills and wished to be the best. He enjoys boasting about himself and dared anyone to question his abilities. He used to have a habit of playing pranks on the other Shimon , and had no qualms about crossing any lines since he had scared the other Shimon into hysteria and didn't regret it when they kicked him out of the tribe.\nHe always wanted to challenge Master Yi because he admired Yi's skills and wanted to be respected back. Training with Yi has humbled Wukong significantly, to the point where he realized the true worth of defending his people, and he values Master Yi's teachings a lot. Even though Wukong still remains arrogant, sometimes his more reckless manners of approach can turn out better than the slow and safe ways like Yi's methods.\n(TBA)\nWukong was trained in the Art of Wuju by Master Yi . Wukong's original name was 'Kong'. When Kong agreed to become his student, Master Yi dubbed him 'Wukong', effectively naming him after the Wuju style. Due to this, they share two similar quotes .\nWukong and Ahri are listed as related champions for unknown reason, possibly because of both being Vastaya .\nTing was once a pupil of Wukong, but he was so overconfident in his own Wuju skills that Wukong sent him to Master Yi to teach him humility.

For millennia, he was trapped beneath the desert sands, but the rise of Shurima freed him from his ancient prison. Driven insane with power, he now seeks to take what he believes is rightfully his and replace the upstart civilizations of the world with one fashioned in his image.\nThree thousand years ago in the ancient Shuriman city of Nerimazeth lived a boy who would be raised as a nameless slave. Despite this harsh environment, the boy was lucky to have loving parents who were able to teach him to read and write, as well as mathematics and history in hopes that these skills could one day lead him to a better life.\nBy a stroke of fate, these skills would prove useful to the young slave when he met the young prince Azir , who befriended the boy and named him Xerath (\"one who shares\") for sharing his knowledge in the library. The least favorite son of the Emperor, Azir was an outcast of the royal family and thus had no problem befriending a lowly slave. Xerath became Azir's attendant, and when he saved the young prince's life from an band of assassins, their bond only strengthened. While the Emperor was furious that his other sons had been killed in the attack (leaving Azir as the sole heir to the throne), Azir himself was grateful and promised Xerath to one day end all slavery in Shurima .\nYears passed, and the Emperor sought to produce a new heir to the throne. Having studied the history of past Shuriman emperors, Xerath knew that Azir's life was in danger and suggested he learn to fight in case an assassin attacked. In return for his advice, Azir promoted Xerath, and with his new position as the prince's right hand Xerath gained access to the forbidden vaults of Shurima's ancient libraries. To protect his friend from the Emperor's wrath, Xerath studied the arts of dark sorcery to place a curse on the queen so she would be unable to carry a child to term.\nFor a time, the curse worked, and Xerath was able to successfully murder each of the Emperor's children before they could be born. But the spell's effect didn't work forever, and eventually the queen gave birth to a son. With no other option, Xerath called upon deadly arcane magic to summon a storm around the queen's chambers, killing her, the Emperor, their guards, and the newborn prince. Xerath blamed mages in the conquered regions of the empire for the assassination, and who would have to face Azir's retribution.\nWhen Azir was crowned Emperor of Shurima, Xerath was ecstatic to be seated at his right hand. But one thing still bothered him: Azir's promise to one day free the slaves so he and Azir could be as brothers. But Azir refused, scolding Xerath for stepping out of line and stating that the release of all the slaves too quickly would lead to the collapse of the Shuriman empire. Furious at this betrayal, Xerath began to secretly plot against his friend, manipulating the young Emperor from the shadows over the next few decades. As Azir's most trusted advisor, Xerath made sure to slowly increase his own power in the empire bit by bit in hopes of one day seizing Shurima for himself.\nAzir's reign as emperor was long and prosperous, and Xerath was at his side, biding his time. Over decades of studying old legends, Xerath formulated a plan that would grant him the power of the gods. The power of Ascension , used by Shuriman heroes of old, could grant Xerath immortality, invulnerability, and the perfect opportunity to usurp the throne. Feeding into the Emperor's hubris, Xerath suggested that Azir, Shurima's greatest emperor, should undergo the ritual that would allow him to join the ranks of Shurima's greatest heroes. Blinded by vanity, Azir agreed with Xerath against the Sun Priests' wishes, and on the day of the ritual Azir made his way to the Dais of Ascension at The Sun Disc .\nHowever, just before Xerath sprung his plan into motion, the magus was shocked when Azir turned around and embraced him, naming him his eternal brother and ending slavery across Shurima. The Emperor's words touched Xerath, but did not sway him from his plans. His ambition was too strong, and as far as Xerath was concerned the gesture had come decades too late. In a swift blast of arcane magic, Xerath vaporized his former friend and took his place at the pedestal, hijacking the ritual to steal the power of the sun itself. The motion caused the collapse of the Sun Disc, the city, and the empire itself, killing everyone in sight as Xerath ascended to the power of the gods.\nHorrified by the magus' treachery, the God-Warrior brothers Renekton and Nasus arrived with a magical sarcophagus to imprison Xerath before he could transform. But it was too late, as Xerath shattered the prison and revealed himself as a being of pure, limitless arcane energy. A great battle followed, which ended in the sacrifice of Renekton as he dragged Xerath into the Tomb of Emperors to be locked away by Nasus, where the two Ascended would continue their battle for thousands of years. Over time, Xerath would twist the weakened Renekton's mind into that of a savage beast, a hollow shell of his former self waiting to be released from eternal darkness.\nThousands of years after Shurima's fall, the ancient Tomb of Emperors was discovered by Noxian noblewoman Cassiopeia and Sivir , the last in Azir's bloodline. After Cassiopeia betrayed Sivir and unsealed the tomb, she was cursed, and from the sand and rubble emerged Xerath and the now insane Renekton.\nDeclaring himself the new Emperor of Shurima, Xerath made his way into the desert seeking new knowledge about the world after millennia trapped beneath the sands. After a battle with Pantheon , the Targonian Aspect of War, Xerath was able to claim the city of Nerimazeth for himself, designating it his base of operations to gather information and restore his strength. Xerath felt Shurima's rise and the rebirth of the newly-Ascended Azir, and knows that this is just the beginning. In time, all mortals will come to serve him...\nXerath is made of pure arcane energy with rocks from his tomb embedded into his person and a chain holding them to his body. Prominent in his appearance is an octagonal piece of rock with a yellow swirl on the centre of it and his head is like the top half of a football and curved downwards and has two eye sockets so he can see.\nAs a young boy, Xerath was a generally kind and empathetic person despite his harsh upbringing as a slave. He was shown to be helpful when he met Azir in the library, and even risked his own life to save Azir from the assassin. As a researcher, Xerath was described to be curious and meticulous when carrying out tasks, and proved to be unusually intelligent, with Azir relying on him for advice for the vast majority of his lifetime.\nHowever, when Xerath began to study dark sorcery, things began to change. Xerath revealed a patiently ambitious, manipulative, even Machiavellian side of himself, cursing and later killing the queen and the emperor with little remorse and simply blaming his actions on an already oppressed region within the empire to suffer Azir's wrath. While Xerath assured himself his heinous crimes were simply to protect Azir, this quickly changed as soon as Azir got in the way of Xerath's goals and aspirations, as he immediately started plotting his old friend's demise. However, Xerath does feel a hint of remorse for treachery after Azir makes good on his promise to free all slaves, but even this is not enough to stop Xerath from putting his plans into action.\nAs the Magus Ascendant, Xerath becomes a godlike megalomaniac with little regard for mortal life, believing that his immortality and prowess in dark sorcery makes him a superior being with the sole right to rule over all mankind. He doesn't regret the cataclysm that resulted from his actions, and even enjoyed his psychological torment of Renekton , showcasing a new found sadism. The defining part of Xerath's personality is his refusal to be a slave to anyone, but as his story suggests, even with the godlike power he has found, he still remains a slave to his own ambition and insanity.\n(TBA)\nNasus and Renekton imprisoned Xerath after the fall of Shurima , but the older brother had to trap his own sibling with him. Xerath is allied with Renekton as they spent millennia together trapped in a tomb. He drove Renekton mad over the ages and turned him into a relentless creature of pure anger. Xerath does not see Renekton as a noble hero, he represents power being granted to the few by a corrupt society. In Xerath's eyes, Renekton helped to guard a city of subjugation. [ 1 ] Xerath later fought Nasus when The Curator of the Sands was trying to protect Sivir , Taliyah and the citizens of Vekaura from Xerath.\nEverything Xerath had done prior to Ascension- heinous as his acts of murder were - were all done out of a twisted sense of loyalty to Azir . When that went unsatisfied Xerath sought the power to free himself from being a slave and tear down the decadent society built on the backs of slaves. From his perspective, Xerath was punishing an injustice against the man who had promised him freedom, but had never given it to him. Azir has returned ascended himself, and is a threat to Xerath. Xerath is hunting down Sivir since her inheriting Azir's royal bloodline may prove a threat to him.\nAccording to Ryze , Xerath is an 'abomination of magic' and that his hold over the magical powers he wields is 'feeble'.\nXerath has fought Pantheon and dozens of Rakkor soldiers.\nSamira's home was destroyed by his followers."}

Xerath is hunting down Sivir since her inheriting Azir's royal bloodline may prove a threat to him.\nAccording to Ryze , Xerath is an 'abomination of magic' and that his hold over the magical powers he wields is 'feeble'.\nXerath has fought Pantheon and dozens of Rakkor soldiers.\nSamira's home was destroyed by his followers."}

As a proud young man, he was falsely accused of murdering his master—unable to prove his innocence, he was forced to slay his own brother in self-defense. In time, his master's true killer was revealed, and his brother mysteriously returned from death, yet Yasuo still could not forgive himself for all he had done. Now, he wanders the world with only the wind to guide his blade.\nYasuo was born in an Ionian village after his father came like an autumn wind into the life of his mother, who was already a widow. His father had left by the time winter settled over the land.\nYasuo grew up to be very close to his half-brother, Yone . However, in contrast to Yone’s respectful and patient personality, Yasuo was often arrogant and impulsive. But after being accepted into the village’s renowned sword school, his determination and talent caught the attention of Elder Souma, the last master of the legendary wind technique. He initially refused the tutelage of Elder Souma, but then Yone gave him a maple seed, symbolizing his plea for Yasuo to show humility. Subsequently, Yasuo accepted the master’s offer and became his apprentice and bodyguard.\nYasuo continued to train in the sword school, and his use of the wind technique made his sparring sessions with Yone a sight to behold.\nWhen news of the Noxian invasion and the Great Stand at Navori reached the school, many of the disciples, including Yone, chose to help defend against the approaching Noxians. Yasuo, however, was ordered to stay back and defend his elders.\nSoon, Yasuo heard drums of a Noxian march and chose to go out and face the enemy, thinking he could turn the tide of the battle. But when he arrived at the battlefield, he found death everywhere. Something unnatural had caused hundreds of Noxians and Ionians to perish.\nWhen Yasuo returned to the school, he found himself surrounded by the remaining students and learned that his master was dead. They accused him of murder, so he fought his way free in the hopes of punishing the true killer.\nWhen Yasuo was tracked down by Yone, they clashed swords, and Yasuo cut down his half-brother, who died before he could grant any absolution.\n(TBA)\nYasuo appears to be a fairly stocky adult man, fair skin with a scar on his nose, brown eyes with green highlights, back-length hair tied in a ponytail, and has a shadow of a beard.\nhis attire consists of a rather torn Ionic samurai-style armor, on his right he has a part of metal armor and the rest is a torn light blue armor that exposes part of his chest, baggy pants, a cloth that covers part of his chest and the face and always carries with him his sword.\n(TBA)\nYasuo is an Ionian swordsman once accused of treason for allegedly murdering Elder Souma, his own master whom he was supposed to protect. He was hunted down across the island continent under the evidence that the killer employed a wind technique, one that only Yasuo has mastered in the present day. He was forced to kill his former allies, likely the entirety of his school.\nHe later crossed paths with Taliyah while on the run, teaching the Shuriman stone mage how to control her powers. When they parted ways, she gifted him a long thread from her handspun wool tunic which he uses to tie his hair up.\nAfter parting way with Taliyah, Yasuo became determined to find the true killer of his Elder. He suspected Riven of being the Elder's killer and confronted her. This was previously evidenced in interaction quotes with her.\n\"Wait, that technique ... huh\" \"Huh, three swift strikes... \" \"Another wind blade?\" \"Who taught you that ?\" Eventually, Riven confessed to unintentionally killing Elder Souma, whose wind technique shattered her blade and killed him with a stray shard. However, Yasuo admitted to dereliction of duty, for he could have protected Elder Souma had he not left to engage the Noxians . Despite being cleared of his accusations, Yasuo is still infamously known across Ionia as the killer of his master.\nYasuo's presence or absence making a difference was highlighted during Riven's trial, when he focused the Wind Technique on Riven's sword as Souma would have, and the shard that killed his master nearly did the same to Asa Konte, Riven's adopted father. This time, Yasuo was able to stop the shard before it could cause any harm.\nIn the second Noxian invasion of Ionia , Irelia's call for help to defend a seaside village from the Noxian army including Sion was met by Akali , Karma , Kennen and Yasuo whose arrival turned the tide of the battle.\nYasuo is the younger half-brother to Yone , who he was very close to. Yone taught Yasuo many important lessons when he was young. When Yasuo was running away when accused of killing Elder Souma, 6 Yone was heartbroken and filled with negative thoughts and feelings that fed an unknown azakana. When Yone finally caught up, Yasuo was forced to kill his own brother whose death would haunt him for a long time.\nLater, when Yasuo went to the Spirit Blossom festival in Weh'le , he was confronted by a resurrected Yone who was trying to kill an azakana that pretended to be a monk from the 3 Greenglade Elder order. [ 1 ] After Yasuo let go of his own past, his brother defeated it. Although Yasuo offered to let Yone have vengeance for his death, he replied that Yasuo might deserve death, but it wouldn't be from Yone. With that, Yasuo stated Ionia had nothing left for him and they parted ways in peace, with Yone saying that even the wind has a path and hoping that the Spirit of Ionia guides his brother.\nHe came across Ahri who was trying to find a guard. They then went to Bilgewater together. During the events of Ruined King , Yasuo, Ahri , Braum , Illaoi , Miss Fortune and Pyke set sail to the Shadow Isles to stop Viego from endangering Bilgewater. After the events of Ruined King , Yasuo left Bilgewater to head to Noxus to search for Riven because he believes that she may need help there. But not before making sure Braum returns to the Freljord safely."}

As a proud young man, he was falsely accused of murdering his master—unable to prove his innocence, he was forced to slay his own brother in self-defense. In time, his master's true killer was revealed, and his brother mysteriously returned from death, yet Yasuo still could not forgive himself for all he had done. Now, he wanders the world with only the wind to guide his blade.\nYasuo was born in an Ionian village after his father came like an autumn wind into the life of his mother, who was already a widow. His father had left by the time winter settled over the land.\nYasuo grew up to be very close to his half-brother, Yone . However, in contrast to Yone’s respectful and patient personality, Yasuo was often arrogant and impulsive. But after being accepted into the village’s renowned sword school, his determination and talent caught the attention of Elder Souma, the last master of the legendary wind technique. He initially refused the tutelage of Elder Souma, but then Yone gave him a maple seed, symbolizing his plea for Yasuo to show humility. Subsequently, Yasuo accepted the master’s offer and became his apprentice and bodyguard.\nYasuo continued to train in the sword school, and his use of the wind technique made his sparring sessions with Yone a sight to behold.\nWhen news of the Noxian invasion and the Great Stand at Navori reached the school, many of the disciples, including Yone, chose to help defend against the approaching Noxians. Yasuo, however, was ordered to stay back and defend his elders.\nSoon, Yasuo heard drums of a Noxian march and chose to go out and face the enemy, thinking he could turn the tide of the battle. But when he arrived at the battlefield, he found death everywhere. Something unnatural had caused hundreds of Noxians and Ionians to perish.\nWhen Yasuo returned to the school, he found himself surrounded by the remaining students and learned that his master was dead. They accused him of murder, so he fought his way free in the hopes of punishing the true killer.\nWhen Yasuo was tracked down by Yone, they clashed swords, and Yasuo cut down his half-brother, who died before he could grant any absolution.\n(TBA)\nYasuo appears to be a fairly stocky adult man, fair skin with a scar on his nose, brown eyes with green highlights, back-length hair tied in a ponytail, and has a shadow of a beard.\nhis attire consists of a rather torn Ionic samurai-style armor, on his right he has a part of metal armor and the rest is a torn light blue armor that exposes part of his chest, baggy pants, a cloth that covers part of his chest and the face and always carries with him his sword.\n(TBA)\nYasuo is an Ionian swordsman once accused of treason for allegedly murdering Elder Souma, his own master whom he was supposed to protect. He was hunted down across the island continent under the evidence that the killer employed a wind technique, one that only Yasuo has mastered in the present day. He was forced to kill his former allies, likely the entirety of his school.\nHe later crossed paths with Taliyah while on the run, teaching the Shuriman stone mage how to control her powers. When they parted ways, she gifted him a long thread from her handspun wool tunic which he uses to tie his hair up.\nAfter parting way with Taliyah, Yasuo became determined to find the true killer of his Elder. He suspected Riven of being the Elder's killer and confronted her. This was previously evidenced in interaction quotes with her.\n\"Wait, that technique ... huh\" \"Huh, three swift strikes... \" \"Another wind blade?\" \"Who taught you that ?\" Eventually, Riven confessed to unintentionally killing Elder Souma, whose wind technique shattered her blade and killed him with a stray shard. However, Yasuo admitted to dereliction of duty, for he could have protected Elder Souma had he not left to engage the Noxians . Despite being cleared of his accusations, Yasuo is still infamously known across Ionia as the killer of his master.\nYasuo's presence or absence making a difference was highlighted during Riven's trial, when he focused the Wind Technique on Riven's sword as Souma would have, and the shard that killed his master nearly did the same to Asa Konte, Riven's adopted father. This time, Yasuo was able to stop the shard before it could cause any harm.\nIn the second Noxian invasion of Ionia , Irelia's call for help to defend a seaside village from the Noxian army including Sion was met by Akali , Karma , Kennen and Yasuo whose arrival turned the tide of the battle.\nYasuo is the younger half-brother to Yone , who he was very close to. Yone taught Yasuo many important lessons when he was young. When Yasuo was running away when accused of killing Elder Souma, 6 Yone was heartbroken and filled with negative thoughts and feelings that fed an unknown azakana. When Yone finally caught up, Yasuo was forced to kill his own brother whose death would haunt him for a long time.\nLater, when Yasuo went to the Spirit Blossom festival in Weh'le , he was confronted by a resurrected Yone who was trying to kill an azakana that pretended to be a monk from the 3 Greenglade Elder order. [ 1 ] After Yasuo let go of his own past, his brother defeated it. Although Yasuo offered to let Yone have vengeance for his death, he replied that Yasuo might deserve death, but it wouldn't be from Yone. With that, Yasuo stated Ionia had nothing left for him and they parted ways in peace, with Yone saying that even the wind has a path and hoping that the Spirit of Ionia guides his brother.\nHe came across Ahri who was trying to find a guard. They then went to Bilgewater together. During the events of Ruined King , Yasuo, Ahri , Braum , Illaoi , Miss Fortune and Pyke set sail to the Shadow Isles to stop Viego from endangering Bilgewater. After the events of Ruined King , Yasuo left Bilgewater to head to Noxus to search for Riven because he believes that she may need help there. But not before making sure Braum returns to the Freljord safely."}

But upon his death at the hands of his brother, he found himself hunted by a malevolent entity of the spirit realm , and was forced to slay it with its own sword. Now, cursed to wear its demonic mask upon his face, Yone tirelessly hunts all such creatures in order to understand what he has become.\nYone was the older half-brother of Yasuo . While Yasuo was impulsive and arrogant, Yone was disciplined and patient.\nAs Yone trained in the village's renowned sword school, his skill with the dual blades drew admiration from his peers. When Yasuo initially denied the personal tutelage of Elder Souma, Yone gifted him a maple seed as a symbol of humility. Later, Yasuo would be taken as Elder Souma's pupil, with Yone's guidance.\nOne day, when news reached the village that Noxus had invaded, Yone and other members of the village went to help defend the land while Yasuo was held back to defend his master.\nWhen Yone returned, Yasuo had disappeared, and Elder Souma was discovered dead.\nWhether Yasuo had shirked his duty or betrayed his master, Yone felt he had failed in his duty to show Yasuo the right path.\nYone and Yasuo clashed in a fated duel and Yasuo's legendary wind technique had the upper hand. Yone died before he was able to learn the truth.\nWhen Yone died, he woke up in the spirit realm, intially being guided by a spirit fox into the afterlife. He eventually went off the path, and ended up being confronted by the azakana that had been hunting him prior to his death. He confronted the azakana, coming out victorious, but not before the azakana would bite his face, hinting to be the cause of his state between life and death. Upon returning to the material realm, he was adorned with a mask reminiscent of the azakana he had faced, unable to remove it, but now able to see azakana in the world around him.\nNow, Yone hunts azakana, using the blade he took from his own demon as the tool to kill them and take their masks. He uses their names as words of power, turning the weakened azakana he hunts into masks, later to be added to his belt.\n(TBA)\nYone in life was a tall young man with white skin, tied dark brown hair, brown eyes and a beard. He wore an Ionian dress with dark aquamarine blue colors with gold trim with a long red belt, seen in his LoR card artwork .\nWhen he came back to life, his appearance changed, now adorning a scarlet red mask on his face that cannot be removed. His hair now worn loose and long with two strands at the front, and his eyes shine in a ghostly blue.\nHis attire consists of torn and bloodstained Ionian clothing, wearing no shirt and instead is covered in primarily bandages that extend up to his shoulders and just below his chest. His robes and belt being decorated with the various azakana he has hunted.\nWhen Yone separates his soul from his body, his appearance is the same but semi-transparent and wrapped in a bright scarlet red.\nYone is a stoic, loyal and honourable man who always put his responsibilities before his feelings. He had a complicated relationship with his brother Yasuo , having to take care of him at a very young age. Yone wished for Yasuo to learn responsibility and have a better life, and was elated when Yasuo was chosen by master Souma as his disciple.\nWhen he discovered Yasuo 's \"betrayal\", Yone was devastated, but continued with his duty which was to, sadly, kill his brother.\nWhen Yone finally found and confronted Yasuo , they ended up dueling to the death, with Yasuo as the victor.\nWhen he returned from the dead, Yone dedicated himself to understanding what he had become through hunting azakana, as he feels that the conflict he now faces with the mask he wears outweighs the unresolved conflict between him and his brother.\nAccording to rumor, Yone and Lillia share a deep friendship, much like the bond between Yasuo and Taliyah .\nYone is the older half-brother to Yasuo , whom he was very close to. Yone taught Yasuo many important lessons when he was young. When Yasuo was running away when accused of killing Elder Souma, 6 Yone was heartbroken and filled with negative thoughts and feelings that fed the azakana he would later confront. When Yone finally caught up, Yasuo was forced to kill his own brother whose death would haunt him for a long time.\nLater, when Yasuo went to the Spirit Blossom festival in Weh'le , he was confronted by a resurrected Yone who was trying to kill an azakana that pretended to be a monk from the 3 Greenglade Elder's order. [ 1 ] After Yasuo let go of his own past, the brother defeated it and parted way in peace, although Yasuo was expecting Yone wanted vengeance. It isn't clear if Yone has forgiven his brother, or if Yasuo has forgiven himself.\nYone met Lillia at some point (likely when they were both traveling to the Spirit Blossom festival of Weh'le ) and has vowed to protect her from any azakana and Demon of Nightmare during their travels.\nUpon Yone's release, it was heavily hinted that the relationship dynamic between Yone and Lillia is meant to mirror the master / student dynamic of Yasuo and Taliyah . The former is mentioned in the story 'The Unforgiven' - \"In her, Yasuo saw an unlikely student, and in himself, an even more unlikely teacher,\" [ 2 ] and the latter is further supported by Michael Yichao, Yone's writer. [ 3 ] \"Fun fact: Yone knows and has met Lillia! He is rather protective of the innocent dream fawn.\" [ 4 ]"}

But upon his death at the hands of his brother, he found himself hunted by a malevolent entity of the spirit realm , and was forced to slay it with its own sword. Now, cursed to wear its demonic mask upon his face, Yone tirelessly hunts all such creatures in order to understand what he has become.\nYone was the older half-brother of Yasuo . While Yasuo was impulsive and arrogant, Yone was disciplined and patient.\nAs Yone trained in the village's renowned sword school, his skill with the dual blades drew admiration from his peers. When Yasuo initially denied the personal tutelage of Elder Souma, Yone gifted him a maple seed as a symbol of humility. Later, Yasuo would be taken as Elder Souma's pupil, with Yone's guidance.\nOne day, when news reached the village that Noxus had invaded, Yone and other members of the village went to help defend the land while Yasuo was held back to defend his master.\nWhen Yone returned, Yasuo had disappeared, and Elder Souma was discovered dead.\nWhether Yasuo had shirked his duty or betrayed his master, Yone felt he had failed in his duty to show Yasuo the right path.\nYone and Yasuo clashed in a fated duel and Yasuo's legendary wind technique had the upper hand. Yone died before he was able to learn the truth.\nWhen Yone died, he woke up in the spirit realm, intially being guided by a spirit fox into the afterlife. He eventually went off the path, and ended up being confronted by the azakana that had been hunting him prior to his death. He confronted the azakana, coming out victorious, but not before the azakana would bite his face, hinting to be the cause of his state between life and death. Upon returning to the material realm, he was adorned with a mask reminiscent of the azakana he had faced, unable to remove it, but now able to see azakana in the world around him.\nNow, Yone hunts azakana, using the blade he took from his own demon as the tool to kill them and take their masks. He uses their names as words of power, turning the weakened azakana he hunts into masks, later to be added to his belt.\n(TBA)\nYone in life was a tall young man with white skin, tied dark brown hair, brown eyes and a beard. He wore an Ionian dress with dark aquamarine blue colors with gold trim with a long red belt, seen in his LoR card artwork .\nWhen he came back to life, his appearance changed, now adorning a scarlet red mask on his face that cannot be removed. His hair now worn loose and long with two strands at the front, and his eyes shine in a ghostly blue.\nHis attire consists of torn and bloodstained Ionian clothing, wearing no shirt and instead is covered in primarily bandages that extend up to his shoulders and just below his chest. His robes and belt being decorated with the various azakana he has hunted.\nWhen Yone separates his soul from his body, his appearance is the same but semi-transparent and wrapped in a bright scarlet red.\nYone is a stoic, loyal and honourable man who always put his responsibilities before his feelings. He had a complicated relationship with his brother Yasuo , having to take care of him at a very young age. Yone wished for Yasuo to learn responsibility and have a better life, and was elated when Yasuo was chosen by master Souma as his disciple.\nWhen he discovered Yasuo 's \"betrayal\", Yone was devastated, but continued with his duty which was to, sadly, kill his brother.\nWhen Yone finally found and confronted Yasuo , they ended up dueling to the death, with Yasuo as the victor.\nWhen he returned from the dead, Yone dedicated himself to understanding what he had become through hunting azakana, as he feels that the conflict he now faces with the mask he wears outweighs the unresolved conflict between him and his brother.\nAccording to rumor, Yone and Lillia share a deep friendship, much like the bond between Yasuo and Taliyah .\nYone is the older half-brother to Yasuo , whom he was very close to. Yone taught Yasuo many important lessons when he was young. When Yasuo was running away when accused of killing Elder Souma, 6 Yone was heartbroken and filled with negative thoughts and feelings that fed the azakana he would later confront. When Yone finally caught up, Yasuo was forced to kill his own brother whose death would haunt him for a long time.\nLater, when Yasuo went to the Spirit Blossom festival in Weh'le , he was confronted by a resurrected Yone who was trying to kill an azakana that pretended to be a monk from the 3 Greenglade Elder's order. [ 1 ] After Yasuo let go of his own past, the brother defeated it and parted way in peace, although Yasuo was expecting Yone wanted vengeance. It isn't clear if Yone has forgiven his brother, or if Yasuo has forgiven himself.\nYone met Lillia at some point (likely when they were both traveling to the Spirit Blossom festival of Weh'le ) and has vowed to protect her from any azakana and Demon of Nightmare during their travels.\nUpon Yone's release, it was heavily hinted that the relationship dynamic between Yone and Lillia is meant to mirror the master / student dynamic of Yasuo and Taliyah . The former is mentioned in the story 'The Unforgiven' - \"In her, Yasuo saw an unlikely student, and in himself, an even more unlikely teacher,\" [ 2 ] and the latter is further supported by Michael Yichao, Yone's writer. [ 3 ] \"Fun fact: Yone knows and has met Lillia! He is rather protective of the innocent dream fawn.\" [ 4 ]"}

Trapped on the Shadow Isles , his only companions are the rotting corpses and shrieking spirits that he gathers to him. Yorick's monstrous actions belie his noble purpose: to free his home from the curse of the Ruination of Helia .\nYorick grew up in a small fishing village on the edge of the Blessed Isles. He could never find acceptance among his peers, and he eventually learned that he could see the spirits of the dead. While at first he was scared of these spirits, he eventually realized that they were just lost and did not want to hurt him. They wanted to find their way to what lay beyond death, and Yorick helped guide them there. While Yorick was happy to guide them, it was a bittersweet task, as he liked talking to these spirits and helping one reach the beyond meant losing a friend.\nTales of Yorick's visions spread and caught the attention of a small religious order of monks called the Brethren of the Dusk. They inducted Yorick into their ranks and gave him a vial of the Waters of Life to wear around his neck, which was common for members of the order. These Waters of Life were magical in nature and could heal someone of almost any injury or ailment. Despite being part of the order, Yorick found himself alone again, shunned by the other monks because he could easily see what they had spent their entire lives trying to understand.\nOne day, as he was tending to his daily duties in the cemetery, Yorick saw a dark cloud moving across the surface of the Isles and devouring everything in its path. This was the Black Mist, created when a young king tried to revive his dead wife in the Waters of Life. As the Mist spread, it caused the monks to pull the vials from their necks before consuming their souls and turning their bodies into corpses. Yorick used all of his willpower to not pull the vial from his neck before being consumed by the Mist.\nWhen he awoke, Yorick had been physically changed, and the Isles had been cleansed of all life. The Black Mist reached for him, but recoiled when it tried to reach for the vial around his neck. He realized that the only thing keeping him alive was the last of the Waters of Life around his neck. Despite searching for days, Yorick found no survivors. In his grief, he talked to the spirits surrounding him. They gravitated to his word, and Yorick realized that he could control them. Determined to free the dead spirits on the Isles, Yorick decided to use these powers to end the curse upon the Isles.\nWhile on their quest to defeat Viego , the Sentinels of Light visited Yorick to ask for help. Seeing that their goals aligned with his, Yorick gave them some of the drops from his vial along with the Maiden of the Mist , which was revealed to be a fetter, containing a piece of Isolde's 's soul.\nYorick is a muscular man with light blue skin and glowing eyes because of his time spent in the Shadow Isles. He wears a dark blue outfit common for those in his position in the Brethren of the Dusk, with no sleeves, fingerless gloves, black shoes, and elongated shoulder pads. Yorick carries with him a large shovel used for digging graves and as a weapon if need be. Around his neck is a glowing light blue vial, containing some of the last drops of the Waters of Life.\nYorick is a quiet and solemn individual. Resigned to his fate long ago, Yorick dutifully digs graves for those who die and have died on the Shadow Isles. While he often talks to the tormented souls around him because of his loneliness and grief and despite caring for the souls, he is aware that they are being controlled by the Mist. His ultimate goal is to find the Ruined King and find a way to let everything in the Shadow Isles die, and in his mind, finally be at peace, including himself.\nIllaoi's faith would compel her to kill a man like Yorick, but her recent experiences had given her enough of an open mind to cooperate with the monk. In their philisophical debate,  Yorick argues that helping the dead find peace is more important than banishing them back into the cycle of life. Furthermore, his power to compel the dead would align with the Buhru law of motion, either by commanding the Black Mist or rescuing tormented spirits.\nYorick dreamt of destroying the Ruined King that decimated Helia. This pursuit would drive him to sacrifice his lifelines, such as leaving his seat of power with Illaoi in the first attempt, or giving away the Maiden and his Water of Life to the Sentinels that would succeed in the second attempt. Although, he was disappointed to learn that Viego's banishment has no effect on the Black Mist, and therefore his own predicament.\nWhen the Sentinels met Yorick, he became confident that their strength could stop Viego once and for all. He sacrificed his powers—the Maiden and the Water of Life—knowing that they will be critical for victory."}

When her master mysteriously disappeared, Yuumi became the Keeper of Norra's sentient Book of Thresholds , traveling through portals in its pages to search for her. Yearning for affection, Yuumi seeks friendly companions to partner with on her journey, protecting them with luminous shields and fierce resolve. While Book strives to keep her on task, Yuumi is often drawn to worldly comforts, such as naps and fish. In the end, however, she always returns to her quest to find her friend.\nShe was born in the realm of the Yordles , and blessed with magical powers of protection but she spent most of her days pouncing at sunbeams, and napping near mouse trees, but she joined Nora on her adventures in material and spirit realms should it spark her interest.\nNorra spent her time collecting strange objects like broken cups, shards of colored glass, and fabric with funny stitching. She examined each artifact with deep reverence, though Yuumi never understood their purpose. Nevertheless, Yuumi would use her magic to protect Norra from harm, and would warm her feet when they returned home.\nThe doorways between realms are finicky and seldom open, even to creatures as dexterous as cats. Yuumi watched as other yordles waited for days for the eastern star to align with a particular stone archway, or waded impatiently between marsh-lilies, seeking a silver blossom blooming from the mud—only then would a pathway appear. But Yuumi’s yordle, Norra, possessed the powerful Book of Thresholds, which allowed her to instantly travel anywhere depicted in its pages. When Norra opened a portal, she and Yuumi would gleefully dive into its glowing paper and arrive at their destination, joined a moment later by the book.\nYuumi never paid the book much attention until one starless night, when she returned home from luring moon-moths with her shinylight to find Norra missing. She saw the book on her master’s desk and flipped through its pages in a panic, noticing that some were torn out entirely. Unable to read its title, Yuumi cried out to it in distress, calling it, simply, “Book”.

Yuumi learned that Norra had gone somewhere so perilous, she had destroyed the portal as she traveled.\nYuumi knew she had to rescue Norra, and turned to Book for help.

While Yuumi would sometimes break from their search to follow the scent of a mouse or restore her strength with a quick catnap, Book was frustratingly cautious, grumpy over lost time and nervous about threats they might encounter. Nevertheless, Yuumi and Book were both determined to find their master and bring her home.\nWhen Yuumi especially missed Norra, she often sought out other companions. One of her favorites was a door-carrying shepherd with thick whiskers and a deep laugh like a babbling brook. Yuumi rested on his shoulders for a time, protecting him from angry snow-spirits stirring up flurries in a hailstorm, while he brought her wriggling fish.\nEventually, Yuumi uncovered the scent of her master lingering in a vast Shuriman ruin.

Despite such humble origins, Zac has grown from primordial ooze into a thinking being who dwells in the city's pipes, occasionally emerging to help those who cannot help themselves or to rebuild the broken infrastructure of Zaun.\nZac was created in Zaun as the Zaun Amorphous Combatant , a synthetic construct of ooze with the ability to react to nearby stimuli and emotions, as a project by Chem-Baron Saito Takeda to create an obedient super soldier who could resist injury and access spaces normal humans couldn't. The blob eventually escaped and stayed in a sump pool, where it reacted to Zaunite children throwing stones at it by throwing them back, causing rumors of a \"Returning Pool\" known among the dwellers of the sump. Several alchymists travelled to the pool to test its psychotropic properties, finding that treating it well made it respond with childlike joy, but causing it pain resulted in it retaliating and killing several personnel.\nOne married couple of alchymists dissented against Takeda's project and saw the blob as a sentient being and gave it the name Zac. The couple tried to vouch for Zac's rights to the organization, but were ignored. They taught Zac about morality and how to be good, but the other alchymists experimented with his empathic senses by performing cruel experiments around him which made Zac feel negative emotions. Refusing to tolerate any more unethical treatment towards Zac, the couple helped him escape during Zaun's Progress Day memorials by storing him in a septic tank and moving him to a faraway part of Zaun. When Takeda found out, he sent his soldiers to search for them. The couple initially wanted to set Zac free, but he wanted to stay with them due to the kindness they showed him, so they happily accepted him and adopted him as their son.\nZac and his alchymist parents went into hiding in a remote part of the sump. As they changed their appearances to avoid recognition, Zac learned how to talk by mimicking their voices. Living with them for many years, they taught Zac about the beauty of the world of Runeterra , but also how it could be cruel sometimes with some people having malice in their hearts, but he remained optimistic and continued to do good deeds. He leisurely roamed Zaun through the small spaces he could travel through, but tended to get overwhelmed by the nearby Zaunites' emotions. He often acted upon his emotions, helping fight against bullies and doing good deeds for Zaunite citizens, but his negative emotions would cause him to destroy entire buildings. The rumors of Zac's sightings were picked up by Takeda, whose alchymists were unable to recreate Zac's sentience, so he sent his henchmen to find his creation and the couple of alchymists whom fled from him.\nTakeda's henchmen eventually found the couple's home and attacked them, ending up killing them despite Takeda ordering them to be taken alive. At the time Zac was casually exploring until he sensed his parents' distress, so he travelled through the pipes of the city as fast as he could, but he found that his parents had already been killed. In a fit of rage and grief, Zac unleashed the true destructive potential of his gelatinous body, killing many of the henchmen but also causing collateral damage to nearby buildings in the process. When he had calmed down, he was overcome with remorse so he rebuilt the damages he caused before moving to live in Zaun's pipe network from then on. Taking in both the positive and negative emotions of the people and occasionally acting upon his urges, Zac became an urban legend in Zaun.\nZac is an amorphous green blob of Zaunite ooze which congeals largely in his hands, forearms, feet, torso, and head. He has a large underbite with his green jaw, yellow eyes, and tail of slime that extends from his head. He can inflate himself into a ball shape.\nZac has an innate ability to feel the emotions of others due to his properties, often feeling overwhelmed by too much positive or negative emotions. Due to his upbringing from his adoptive parents, Zac has a kind, optimistic outlook of life and enjoys helping others, though when there are negative emotions around him he stops to intervene at best and lashes out in destructive tantrums at worst. He was overcome by rage towards his parents' deaths in the hands of Saito Takeda's men, yet felt remorse for the destruction he caused during his outburst, rebuilding everything he's damaged before choosing to live in the sewers alone. He feels a strong aversion to violence around him, yet usually remains in a calm demeanor when he fights.\nZac was born from a chem spill in Zaun's Sump level, gaining basic sentience to respond to outside stimuli. He was sequestered in a laboratory by a group of alchymists funded by Chem-Baron Saito Takeda, to be molded into a super soldier under his command. Two of the alchymists grew emotionally attached to Zac and, when they discovered who their benefactor was, spirited away with him deep within Zaun, lovingly raising him as their own son while being on the run from baron Takeda's thugs.\nZac responds to people's emotions and acts accordingly, his mood changing with the reigning sentiment at any given time, best exemplified when he went berserk after his parents were killed by Takeda's men. After burying them, he decided to set off and help the people of Zaun, fighting chem-thugs and fixing the city's infrastructure when the opportunity presents itself."}

Zac is unable to move or attack while his left arm is in flight.\nW - Cell Division: Innate - The Secret Weapon: Zac gains increased percentage size equal to Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) 1. 5 % of his bonus health , capped at 35% increased size at Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) 2333. 3 3 bonus health . Zac's size also reduces based on his Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) missing health , down to 70% total size while at Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) 0% health .\nInnate - Goo: Whenever Zac damages at least one enemy with an ability , he sheds a number of chunks of himself to a nearby location, landing towards nearby visible enemy champions and lasting for 6 seconds.\nBoth Zac and enemy champions can interact with a chunk by being within 50 units of it: an enemy will destroy it, while Zac will consume it to heal for Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) 4% − 8% (based on level) of his maximum health .\nInnate - Cell Division: Periodically, upon taking fatal damage , Zac enters resurrection for 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4 (based on level) seconds, instantly restoring Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) 50% of his maximum health and becoming untargetable and unable to act for the duration. Zac then splits into four uncontrollable bloblets away from his location, though stopping at terrain. After 1. 5 seconds of the bloblets being untargetable , they start moving toward Zac's location over the remaining duration . Any damage the bloblets receive, excluding damage dealt in excess of each of their Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) total health , is also redirected to Zac as Skillshots dodged with Void Surge (Q) true damage . While in resurrection, Zac cannot take damage from sources other than the redirected damage from his bloblets .\nAfter the duration, Zac is revived with Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) 10 – 50% maximum health . Zac will die once all bloblets are killed.\nSee Pets for stats and details for bloblets.\nE - Elastic Slingshot: Active: Zac charges for up to 4. 5 seconds to increase Elastic Slingshot's range over a cone in the target direction.\nElastic Slingshot can be recast within the duration. If Zac cancels the channel himself, or the charge completes without reactivation, 50% of Elastic Slingshot's Champions killed with Comeuppance (R) health cost and cooldown are refunded.\nRecast: Zac leaps to the target location. Upon landing, he deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E) magic damage to nearby enemies and knocks them up and stuns them for 0. 5 seconds, increased to 1 second if Elastic Slingshot was charged for more than 1 second.\nElastic Slingshot will cast at max range if cast beyond that.\nR - Let's Bounce!: Active: Zac bounces after the cast time, then bounces 3 additional times each second over 3 seconds, during which he also gains Champions killed 5s before or after using Chronobreak (R) 20% − 50% (based on duration) bonus movement speed but becomes unable to declare basic attacks and cast Stretching Strikes and Elastic Slingshot .\nEach bounce deals Damage mitigated with Shifting Sands (E) magic damage to enemies hit, knocks them back over 1 second, and slows them by 20% for the same duration.\nAn enemy can be hit by multiple bounces, but ones beyond the first deal 50% damage to them and do not apply the knock back .\nLore:\n.\nZaun Amorphous Combatant Titles Nickname (s) Zac Alias (es) The Secret Weapon Characteristics Species Ooze Golem Pronoun (s) He/Him Timeline Born: 986 AN - 994 AN Weapon (s) Ooze Body Personal status Status Alive (Constructed) Place of origin Zaun Current residence Zaun Family Unnamed Adoptive Father † (Creator) Unnamed Adoptive Mother † (Creator) Professional status Occupation (s) Watchman Handyman Region (s) Zaun Champion Zac/LoL Related character (s) Twitch\nZac is the product of a toxic spill that ran through a chemtech seam and pooled in an isolated cavern deep in Zaun's Sump. Despite such humble origins, Zac has grown from primordial ooze into a thinking being who dwells in the city's pipes, occasionally emerging to help those who cannot help themselves or to rebuild the broken infrastructure of Zaun.\nZac was created in Zaun as the Zaun Amorphous Combatant , a synthetic construct of ooze with the ability to react to nearby stimuli and emotions, as a project by Chem-Baron Saito Takeda to create an obedient super soldier who could resist injury and access spaces normal humans couldn't. The blob eventually escaped and stayed in a sump pool, where it reacted to Zaunite children throwing stones at it by throwing them back, causing rumors of a \"Returning Pool\" known among the dwellers of the sump. Several alchymists travelled to the pool to test its psychotropic properties, finding that treating it well made it respond with childlike joy, but causing it pain resulted in it retaliating and killing several personnel.\nOne married couple of alchymists dissented against Takeda's project and saw the blob as a sentient being and gave it the name Zac. The couple tried to vouch for Zac's rights to the organization, but were ignored. They taught Zac about morality and how to be good, but the other alchymists experimented with his empathic senses by performing cruel experiments around him which made Zac feel negative emotions. Refusing to tolerate any more unethical treatment towards Zac, the couple helped him escape during Zaun's Progress Day memorials by storing him in a septic tank and moving him to a faraway part of Zaun. When Takeda found out, he sent his soldiers to search for them. The couple initially wanted to set Zac free, but he wanted to stay with them due to the kindness they showed him, so they happily accepted him and adopted him as their son.\nZac and his alchymist parents went into hiding in a remote part of the sump. As they changed their appearances to avoid recognition, Zac learned how to talk by mimicking their voices. Living with them for many years, they taught Zac about the beauty of the world of Runeterra , but also how it could be cruel sometimes with some people having malice in their hearts, but he remained optimistic and continued to do good deeds. He leisurely roamed Zaun through the small spaces he could travel through, but tended to get overwhelmed by the nearby Zaunites' emotions. He often acted upon his emotions, helping fight against bullies and doing good deeds for Zaunite citizens, but his negative emotions would cause him to destroy entire buildings. The rumors of Zac's sightings were picked up by Takeda, whose alchymists were unable to recreate Zac's sentience, so he sent his henchmen to find his creation and the couple of alchymists whom fled from him.\nTakeda's henchmen eventually found the couple's home and attacked them, ending up killing them despite Takeda ordering them to be taken alive. At the time Zac was casually exploring until he sensed his parents' distress, so he travelled through the pipes of the city as fast as he could, but he found that his parents had already been killed. In a fit of rage and grief, Zac unleashed the true destructive potential of his gelatinous body, killing many of the henchmen but also causing collateral damage to nearby buildings in the process. When he had calmed down, he was overcome with remorse so he rebuilt the damages he caused before moving to live in Zaun's pipe network from then on. Taking in both the positive and negative emotions of the people and occasionally acting upon his urges, Zac became an urban legend in Zaun.\nZac is an amorphous green blob of Zaunite ooze which congeals largely in his hands, forearms, feet, torso, and head. He has a large underbite with his green jaw, yellow eyes, and tail of slime that extends from his head. He can inflate himself into a ball shape.\nZac has an innate ability to feel the emotions of others due to his properties, often feeling overwhelmed by too much positive or negative emotions. Due to his upbringing from his adoptive parents, Zac has a kind, optimistic outlook of life and enjoys helping others, though when there are negative emotions around him he stops to intervene at best and lashes out in destructive tantrums at worst. He was overcome by rage towards his parents' deaths in the hands of Saito Takeda's men, yet felt remorse for the destruction he caused during his outburst, rebuilding everything he's damaged before choosing to live in the sewers alone. He feels a strong aversion to violence around him, yet usually remains in a calm demeanor when he fights.\nZac was born from a chem spill in Zaun's Sump level, gaining basic sentience to respond to outside stimuli. He was sequestered in a laboratory by a group of alchymists funded by Chem-Baron Saito Takeda, to be molded into a super soldier under his command. Two of the alchymists grew emotionally attached to Zac and, when they discovered who their benefactor was, spirited away with him deep within Zaun, lovingly raising him as their own son while being on the run from baron Takeda's thugs.\nZac responds to people's emotions and acts accordingly, his mood changing with the reigning sentiment at any given time, best exemplified when he went berserk after his parents were killed by Takeda's men. After burying them, he decided to set off and help the people of Zaun, fighting chem-thugs and fixing the city's infrastructure when the opportunity presents itself."}

During the war, desperation led him to unlock the secret shadow form—a malevolent spirit magic as dangerous and corrupting as it is powerful. Zed has mastered all of these forbidden techniques to destroy anything he sees as a threat to his nation, or his new order.\nA low class mother gave birth to Govos. When he was young, Govos saw his father walk out on their family. Born as a Northern peasant child, Govos was a servant at the Thaanjul monastery at around age 10. For two years, nobody from the Kinkou would claim him as their neophyte and apprentice.  A servant boy whose duties included washing floors and cleaning dishes, he only had spare time to train in the evenings after all his work was done. As a child, it was his dream to become a Kinkou warrior. It was his hope that if he showed his determination, that Kusho wouldn't walk out on Govos the way his father had. The opportunity finally came to him when Master Kusho and his son Shen walked up to Govos. Kusho ordered his son to spar with the servant child. Govos did not do well at first, but he continued to spar over and over again. On the last chance he had, Shen purposefully let Govos hit him. Govos' new family would nurse him back to health from the hours of sparring that occurred that day and Master Kusho would take Zed on as his student.\nAt the age of around 15, Govos, Shen, and Master Kusho disguised themselves as merchants and journeyed to track down the Golden Demon. Pulling their supply cart, Govos and Shen discussed their childhood friend and Shen's now-future-fiancée, Yevnai. At the end of the cliffside, they see smoke and mutilated bodies for the first time. Kusho calls for them to aid Kotha Village's survivors. Govos is left to aid with healing and surgery, as he is less hesitant to make judgement calls. Govos heals and aids the wounded and through the traumatizing experience of letting some die, to save others, he learns a Kinkou lesson known as \"The Lesson of the Scales\". After the ordeal, Kusho sits beside his apprentice to give him the Amulet of the Eye of Twilight, as well as the name Usan. His new name is one of status and means \"the strength of compassion\" and is explained to him through tears that \"it is the word for the pillar that bears the heaviest load\".\nAs Usan and Shen investigated the Golden Demon's killings, the trauma of seeing the gruesome crime scenes shook the two to their core. Eventually, they managed to catch the Golden Demon, revealed to be a stagehand named Khada Jhin . Usan prepared to kill the criminal, but Kusho intervened, ordering Jhin to be imprisoned instead. Usan struggled in his studies as he was shaken by Jhin's crimes and the tensions between Noxus ' ongoing encroachment on Ionia , disillusioning his perspective of balance and filling him with a vengeful desire to punish evil.\nLater, Usan found a box within the temple's hidden catacombs which contained the Tears of Shadow, a magical ichor gave him the ability to control shadow magic, at the expense of tainting his mind with darkness. He proposed for the Kinkou to strike the Noxians down with everything they had, but Kusho refused. Usan left the Kinkou and decided to take justice into his own hands. Taking on the name Zed, he formed the Shadow Order , a group of former Kinkou disciples with a goal to defend Ionia by any extreme means necessary. Realizing that the magic within the black box was a requirement for his goal, Zed and his acolytes raided the temple. When confronted by Kusho, Zed made a deal with him to fake the latter's death in exchange for uniting Ionia to fight in the war. After slaying the remaining Kinkou, the Shadow Order claimed the temple as their own and they imbued themselves with the Tears of Shadow, learning how to fight alongside their shadows.\nZed later witnessed a massacre in Bahrl , as a warning by Noxus that they would show no mercy. One of the child soldiers that Noxus sent, named Shieda Kayn , harbored tenacity and perseverance that Zed saw potential in, so he recruited him into the Shadow Order. Kayn quickly grew to master every weapon in the Order's possession, with great proficiency in stealth and assassination.\nWith the Order of Shadow's future ahead, Zed knew that his actions could not be undone, but he must do whatever it takes to secure Ionia's triumph.\n(TBA)\nZed is a muscular but slimly built man with brown eyes, fair skin, and shaggy white hair. His signature armor is a menacing ninja regalia, draped with dark red and blue fabrics tucked into dark gray metal with golden accents.

As an inventor's assistant in Piltover , he was bored by his predictable life and befriended a mad, blue-haired bomber named Jinx . After a wild night on the town, Ziggs took her advice and moved to Zaun , where he now explores his fascinations more freely, terrorizing the chem-barons and regular citizens alike in his never ending quest to blow stuff up.\nZiggs was born with a talent for tinkering, but his chaotic, hyperactive nature was unusual among yordle scientists. Aspiring to be a revered inventor like Heimerdinger, he rattled through ambitious projects with manic zeal, emboldened by both his explosive failures and his unprecedented discoveries. Word of Ziggs' volatile experimentation reached the famed Yordle Academy in Piltover and its esteemed professors invited him to demonstrate his craft. His characteristic disregard for safety brought the presentation to an early conclusion, however, when the hextech engine Ziggs was demonstrating overheated and exploded, blowing a huge hole in the wall of the Academy. The professors dusted themselves off and sternly motioned for him to leave. Devastated, Ziggs prepared to return to Bandle City in shame. However, before he could leave, a group of Zaunite agents infiltrated the Academy and kidnapped the professors. The Piltover military tracked the captives to a Zaunite prison, but their weapons were incapable of destroying the fortified walls. Determined to outdo them, Ziggs began experimenting on a new kind of armament, and quickly realized that he could harness his accidental gift for demolition to save the captured yordles.\nBefore long, Ziggs had created a line of powerful bombs he lovingly dubbed ''hexplosives.'' With his new creations ready for their first trial, Ziggs traveled to Zaun and sneaked into the prison compound. He launched a gigantic bomb at the prison and watched with glee as the explosion tore through the reinforced wall. Once the smoke had cleared, Ziggs scuttled into the facility, sending guards running with a hail of bombs. He rushed to the cell, blew the door off its hinges, and led the captive yordles to freedom. Upon returning to the Academy, the humbled professors recognized Ziggs with an honorary title - Dean of Demolitions. Vindicated at last, Ziggs accepted the proposal, eager to bring his ever-expanding range of hexplosives to greater Valoran.\nLike all yordles he is the size of a dwarf has cat like ears, and a beige like colored fur. He wears armor with goggles with green lenses, and has a giant bomb on his back.\nIf the grin didn't get through to anyone he is a wild, and chaotic force of nature who has a passion for 2 things, bombs and explosions and refers to it as art than science. Despite his chaotic nature, he won't let children get hurt, and will do so by putting himself in harms way, and he doesn't kill anyone on purpose.\nZiggs is quite terrified of Jinx (she constantly wants to hug him). Jinx believes he is a product of her imagination, more specifically her conscience. After a night of mischiefs with her all around Piltover , Ziggs now lives with her in Zaun .\nZiggs sees Heimerdinger as his idol and used to work for him before going to Zaun with Jinx."}

Vindicated at last, Ziggs accepted the proposal, eager to bring his ever-expanding range of hexplosives to greater Valoran.\nLike all yordles he is the size of a dwarf has cat like ears, and a beige like colored fur. He wears armor with goggles with green lenses, and has a giant bomb on his back.\nIf the grin didn't get through to anyone he is a wild, and chaotic force of nature who has a passion for 2 things, bombs and explosions and refers to it as art than science. Despite his chaotic nature, he won't let children get hurt, and will do so by putting himself in harms way, and he doesn't kill anyone on purpose.\nZiggs is quite terrified of Jinx (she constantly wants to hug him). Jinx believes he is a product of her imagination, more specifically her conscience. After a night of mischiefs with her all around Piltover , Ziggs now lives with her in Zaun .\nZiggs sees Heimerdinger as his idol and used to work for him before going to Zaun with Jinx."}
